// What is already standing when the match begins (GameDesign.md §2 and §5): "the base level in the
// lobby decides", and the levels are "nothing is a builder and a command post; small adds two
// served extractors, a generator and a factory; established adds a lab, a repair bay and four
// hardpoints".
//
// THIS IS THE APPLICATION'S AND NOT THE SIMULATION'S, which is a ruling the tree already carries:
// Tests/GameLogicTests/AiTests.cpp places its own base and says why - "NOTHING IN THE TREE OWNS
// BASE-LEVEL PLACEMENT YET - it is the application's (m1-vertical-slice/G1), and until G1 lands a
// match is set up by whoever starts one". This is G1 landing. It stays out of Sim because a tick
// never does it: it happens once, before tick 0, from the lobby's settings, and a Sim that could do
// it would be a Sim with a notion of "the start" that its own loop has no use for.
//
// IT USES Sim's MUTABLE DOOR DELIBERATELY. Sim::Objects(), Sim::SeatAt, Sim::FlattenTerrain and
// Sim::SetObstruction exist for exactly this - Sim.h says the mutable world "exists for the same
// reason FlattenTerrain does" - and the alternative, an order stream, cannot express it: an order
// builds a structure over its build time with a builder that does not exist yet.
//
// AND IT FLATTENS, WHICH THE TEST FIXTURE DOES NOT. Construction.cpp levels the ground under a
// footprint the moment construction begins and writes the mean into Structure::y; a base that
// skipped that step would have every starting command post at y = 0, which is sea level, and the
// renderer would draw it buried. The test fixture never noticed because no test of it draws.
