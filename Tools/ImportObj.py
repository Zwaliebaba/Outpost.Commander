"""Convert a Wavefront OBJ into the model JSON NeuronCore/ModelDesc.h loads.

The owner authors models in OBJ (TechnicalDesign.md 8), so this is the importer that exists before
the models do. What it carries across is what a Frontier model is: positions, one flat colour per
triangle, markers, and fragments.

COLOUR COMES FROM THE MATERIAL, and a material is a name in the OBJ and a `Kd` line in the MTL
beside it. A triangle's colour is its face's material, which is what "one colour per triangle"
means when the authoring tool thinks in materials. A material whose `d` (dissolve) is zero becomes
the TEAM-COLOUR SLOT: alpha zero, which the pixel shader draws neither lit nor fogged (ADR-005).
Zero opacity is the one thing an artist can set in any tool and that no real surface wants, so it
is the flag rather than a naming convention that a rename would break.

AN OBJECT NAMED Marker<Name> IS A MARKER, not geometry. Its origin is the marker's position - the
mean of its vertices, so a small cross or a cone works as well as a single point - and its
orientation comes from the direction its geometry points, taken as the vector from the first vertex
to the last. Markers are how a device is a tree: MarkerDrive* carry the drive, MarkerMount* the
modules, MarkerMuzzle the shot.

AN OBJECT NAMED Fragment<Name> IS A FRAGMENT: a piece that comes away when the thing is destroyed,
as the Species models carried them. Its triangles are geometry like any other and are tagged with
the fragment's index.

WINDING. An OBJ face is counter-clockwise seen from outside; ADR-011's outward normal is
cross(c - a, b - a), which is clockwise from outside. The importer therefore REVERSES each face,
and `--check` re-reads a written model and reports the signed volume of every closed part, so that
a model imported inside out is caught here rather than in a log nobody reads.

UNITS. An OBJ is in whatever the artist worked in; the simulation is in subunits, 256 to the world
unit (ADR-002). --scale says how many subunits one OBJ unit is, and defaults to the 256 that makes
one OBJ unit one world unit.
