"""Convert the Species BMP textures to the uncompressed DDS this game reads.

`TechnicalDesign.md` section 8 asks for exactly this tool: it "converts the Species BMPs to DDS,
expanding the 8-bit ones through their palette and turning a sprite's colour key into alpha, and
writes uncompressed DDS itself -- a header and the pixels". The output is top-down
`B8G8R8A8_UNORM` with no mip chain, the DX10 header form `NeuronCore/TextureFile.cpp` validates, and the
same header this tree's `MakeTerrainPalette.py` already writes.

**The alpha channel is the whole problem, and BMP has none.** Every pixel of a Species BMP loads
opaque -- `NeuronClient/Bitmap.cpp:162` for 24-bit and `:126` for the 4- and 8-bit palettes set
`a = 255` unconditionally -- so the alpha a DDS must carry has to be derived. Species derived it
one way and one way only: `Resource::GetTexture` (`NeuronClient/Resource.cpp:99`) calls
`ConvertPinkToTransparent` (`Bitmap.cpp:695`) unless the caller passes `_masked=false`, and that
keys **exactly** magenta (255, 0, 255) to alpha 0, setting the keyed texel's colour to mid-grey so
that filtering cannot bleed magenta into the edges. Nothing else in the tree writes an alpha:
`ConvertColourToAlpha` (`:680`) exists, would have copied a channel into alpha, and **has no
callers at all**.

That leaves most of the take list with no alpha and no key, and they work in Species because they
are drawn **additively** -- `glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE)` or `(GL_ONE, GL_ONE)` at every
effect-sprite, icon and font draw. Under an additive blend a black texel contributes nothing
because its *colour* is zero, whatever its alpha, which is why Species never needed one. So:

* **Black is the transparent end, but not through alpha, and not as a key.** It is a continuous
  falloff, not a cutout: `Glow` and `Starburst` are 128x128 greyscale blobs with 219 and 253
  distinct grey levels. Keying black to alpha 0 and leaving the rest opaque would turn a soft
  blob into a hard-edged disc.
* This tool therefore writes **alpha = luminance** for those, and **leaves RGB untouched**. That
  is strictly more information than Species carried, and it costs nothing: an additive pass can
  ignore alpha and get Species' result exactly, while an alpha-blended or alpha-tested pass now
  has something correct to read.
* **The one way to get it wrong** is to draw a luminance-alpha texture with `SRC_ALPHA, ONE`. That
  multiplies the falloff by itself and the blob comes out far tighter and darker than Species.
  An additive pass over these textures wants `ONE, ONE`, or `SRC_ALPHA` with the shader supplying
  the alpha rather than the texture.

The rules, one per texture, are in MANIFEST below, and `--analyze` checks each one against the
pixels rather than trusting it: it reports what a file actually contains and refuses a row whose
declared rule the content contradicts -- a `key` row with no magenta in it, or a `luminance` row
with no dark pixels to become transparent.

Like every importer under Tools, this never ships (`AGENTS.md` R14), is run by hand, and its
output is committed. It needs no third-party module.
