"""Select the WAVs a Species Sounds.txt references, and copy them where the game will look.

It exists for m2-skirmish/T9, which authors the sound events, and it COPIES NOTHING NOW
(m1-vertical-slice/C4): M1's GameData/Sounds.json is empty on purpose, and a file under Sounds that
no event names would be a file nobody can account for. Run without --copy it lists what an event
set would need, which is the shape T9 starts from.

WHAT Sounds.txt SAYS. Blocks of

    ENTITY <name>
        EVENT <name>
            SOUNDNAME   <wav stem, or a list of stems>
            SOURCETYPE  <n>
            ...

A SOUNDNAME IS OFTEN A GROUP RATHER THAN A FILE. `0lasers` is not Sounds/0lasers.wav; it is the
name of a set, and Species resolves it to Laser1.wav through Laser11.wav at load. So a name is
matched as a file first and, failing that, as a case-insensitive prefix of one or more files, which
is reported as a GUESS and not as a match: 163 names resolve to 54 files exactly and the rest are
groups. Everything but SOUNDNAME is Species's own mixer settings and is read past, because
Outpost's sound event row (Content/SoundEventDesc.h) carries its own.

THE PROVENANCE. Which of these may be taken is the provenance ADR's to say, not this tool's; the
soundtrack, the branding and the narration are excluded regardless (SpeciesLineage.md 1). The tool
names what it would copy so that a person decides, and refuses to copy anything the exclusion list
matches.
