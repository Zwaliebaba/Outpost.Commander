THIS FILE IS THE SPECIFICATION OF THE GENERATOR. The C++ port in Sim (m0-foundation/T17) must
produce the same int16 heights for the same definition, sample for sample, and is tested against
the goldens this tool writes. Every operation below is integer: shifts floor (Python >> on a
negative number is arithmetic, as C++20 defines it), divisions are on non-negative operands,
products that could exceed 32 bits are noted where the C++ port must widen to int64.

THE ALGORITHM, from SpeciesTerrain.md §4 and §5 with the two float exponentials replaced by the
tables of Tools/FractalTable.py:

  A landscape of a size class has cells_per_side cells and samples_per_side = cells * 4 + 1
  samples at a spacing of 16 world units, every sample OUTSIDE_HEIGHT to begin with (in 24.8
  fixed point: whole units * 256). The recipe of the size class turns the match seed into a
  list of tiles; a tile is generated on its own grid of extent + 1 samples a side (extent a
  power of two) and merged into the landscape by maximum.

  Tile generation, on the tile's generator seeded by derive_seed(match seed, tile index):
    every grid sample starts at OUTSIDE_HEIGHT; amplitude = tile.amplitude * 256; step = extent
    while step >= 2:
      half = step / 2
      for every square (x, y) of the current step, rows then columns:
        the square midpoint (x+half, y+half) = base + noise(base), base from the four corners
        if y > 0: the top edge midpoint (x+half, y) = base + noise(base), base from the four
          samples at distance half (the two corners left and right, the centres above and below)
        if x > 0: the left edge midpoint (x, y+half), likewise (corners above and below, centres
          left and right)
      amplitude = (amplitude * FALLOFF_16_16[fd]) >> 16
      step = half
    then every sample += tile.height_shift * 256
    then, if tile.edge_falloff > 0, every sample within edge_falloff samples of the grid's border
      is pulled toward OUTSIDE_HEIGHT in proportion to its distance d from the nearest border:
      raw = OUTSIDE + (max(raw, OUTSIDE) - OUTSIDE) * d / edge_falloff (a 64-bit product)
  The grid's border samples are never generated and stay at OUTSIDE_HEIGHT, which is what makes a
  tile an island. The shift lifts a tile's plain; the falloff, applied after it, brings the tile
  back down to the sea at its border, so a lifted island still has a coast. The edge falloff is
  this port's addition to Species, because method 1 drops to the border in a random staircase
  and a hill tile placed on land otherwise ends in a straight cliff along its edge. Method 0 takes the mean of the four (sum >> 2); method 1 draws one bit and takes
  the mean of one diagonal (square) or of the horizontal or vertical pair (diamond), (a + b) >> 1;
  method 2 draws below(4) and takes that one sample. The draw for the base comes first, then the
  draw for the noise.
  noise(base): lowland = 6554 + ((9830 * LOWLAND_POWER_16_16[s][min(|base| >> 8, 255)]) >> 16), the
  Species 0.1 + 0.15 * |base|^s in 16.16; n = below(2 * amplitude + 1) - amplitude; result
  (n * lowland) >> 16. (9830 * table entry fits in 64 bits; the C++ port widens.)

  Merge: raw = max(sample, OUTSIDE); if the tile's maximum is above OUTSIDE,
  h = OUTSIDE + (raw - OUTSIDE) * (desired * 256 - OUTSIDE) / (max - OUTSIDE) with a 64-bit
  product and a non-negative numerator, else h = raw; landscape[y][x] = max(landscape, h) for the
  tile samples that fall inside the landscape.

  The int16 height of a sample is fixed >> 8. Sea level is 0: a sample below 0 is under water.

CELLS AND MEASUREMENTS (also the spec for Sim's derived grids and the tool's guarantees):
  cell (cx, cy) holds samples 4cx..4cx+4 by 4cy..4cy+4. water = the lowest of its 25 samples is
  below 0. slope percent = the largest |difference| between two horizontally or vertically
  adjacent samples in the cell * 100 / 16. A drive passes a land cell whose slope is at most its
  limit (Wheels 25, HalfTrack 35, Tracks 40, Hover 20); Hover also passes water. A 3x3 footprint
  is buildable when its nine cells are land and (highest sample - lowest sample) * 100 / 192 < 25.

Runs on the standard library alone; --render writes its own PNG.
