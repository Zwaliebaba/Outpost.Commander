// Stage 10 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): the damage stages 8 and 9 decided is applied,
// what reaches nought is destroyed and leaves a wreck, the killer gains experience, and what is
// hurt enough breaks off (GameDesign.md §8; m1-vertical-slice/S10).
//
// WHY DAMAGE IS A QUEUE AND NOT A WRITE AT THE SHOT. The tick's stages are named for what they do:
// stage 8 acquires and fires, stage 9 lands the shells, and stage 10 is "damage, destruction,
// wrecks, experience". Two shooters that both fire at one device in one tick must both be firing
// at a device that is alive, because both fired before either shot landed - and a write at the
// shot makes the second shooter's tick depend on whether the first happened to be walked first.
// A queue makes the order of the walk stop mattering: the two shots are both fired, both applied,
// and the target dies once.
//
// THE FORMULA IS CONTENT'S, NOT THIS TASK'S. Content/DamageTable.h carries DamageDealt, because
// the design screen and Tools/CheckBalance.py apply it too, and a second implementation here is a
// second thing to keep in step. What this file adds is which armour a target offers and which
// column of the matrix it is hit in.
