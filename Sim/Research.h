// Stage 3 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): the research tree of GameDesign.md §7, in labs
// that work in parallel, with upgrades that reach what is already in the field
// (m1-vertical-slice/S6). Free functions, as stages 4 and 5 are: the progress is on the seat and
// the labs are structures, and a tick moves one number.
//
// AN UPGRADE IS WRITTEN ONCE, TO THE SEAT, AND NOT TO EVERY DEVICE. Seat::upgrades is what every
// derivation reads (Sim/Design.h), so the moment a percentage lands there every design of that
// class answers the new number - including designs of devices built an hour ago, because nothing
// derived is stored on a device. What completing an upgrade DOES have to walk the world for is the
// one thing that is stored: the current hit points. A device at half health must still be at half
// health when its maximum grows, which is what "hit points keeping their fraction" means, and it
// is a multiply per object on an event that happens a few dozen times a match.
//
// TWO EFFECTS HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. ExtractorRate and StructureHitPoints are upgrades to things
// that are not a chassis or a weapon class, and ClassUpgrades had no room for them; they are two
// more fields on it rather than two more places an upgrade can live, because one home for
// "what research has done to this commander" is the property that makes a derivation trustworthy.
//
// THE UNLOCK EFFECT DOES NOTHING HERE, and that is not an omission. A row says what unlocks it
// (`unlockedBy`) and a research item says what it unlocks (`unlocks`); the simulation reads the
// first, so an item completing is already the whole of the unlock the moment it joins
// researchComplete. The second direction is what the research panel lists and what
// ContentValidator checks, and it is deliberately not a second mechanism.
