// its own: it is a Structure in StructurePhase::Plan. A second record would be a second thing to
// keep in the hash, in the snapshot and in the render view, and every one of the four transitions
// below would have to move a structure between two containers without ever losing or duplicating
// it. One record with a state is the same information and cannot desynchronise from itself.

// Plan -> UnderConstruction -> Standing, with Demolishing between Standing and gone, and a plan or
// a site cancelled straight out of the world. What the state decides, and the whole of what it
// decides, is in this header: whether the cells are occupied, and whether the commander has paid.
