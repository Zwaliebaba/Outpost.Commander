// What a planner hands a mover (TechnicalDesign.md §4.5). A path is cells, because movement is on
// the heightfield and a cell is what the obstruction grid and the passability rules speak in; the
// subunit positions a device actually walks are S8's, steering between these.
//
// A PATH IS REFINED FROM THE FRONT. Hierarchical planning finds the sequence of clusters first and
// turns clusters into cells afterwards, so a long path exists as a few refined clusters and a tail
// of abstract nodes. The device walks the refined part while the planner refines the next, which
// is what keeps a Frontier-sized request off one tick.
