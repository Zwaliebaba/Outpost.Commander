// What an explored-but-not-visible map shows (TechnicalDesign.md §4.6): the last-seen record of
// every structure a commander has ever seen. It is what an attack on an unseen target is
// redirected to (GameDesign.md §8), what a rejoining client gets back, and the reason a commander
// who scouted a base once still sees it drawn after the scout dies.
//
// A ghost is stale by design. The structure may be long destroyed and the record stays until the
// commander sees the cell again; that is the whole point of it.
//
// Only structures. A device moves, so a record of where one was a minute ago is a lie rather than
// a memory, and GameDesign.md §3 says fog hides devices outright.
