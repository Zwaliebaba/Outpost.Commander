// The deposits of a landscape (GameDesign.md §4): the points an extractor may be built on, and
// nowhere else. They come from the landscape's definition, which means a snapshot already carries
// them and a joining client already reproduces them; nothing here is state.
//
// A deposit is deliberately NOT an object in World. It has no id, because nothing ever refers to
// one: an extractor knows the cell it stands on and that is the whole of the relationship. Giving
// it an id would put a sixth kind in ObjectKind and a sixth map in World for a record that never
// changes, is never destroyed and is never pointed at. Feature.h says the same thing from the
// other side. What the simulation needs is one question answered quickly - is there a deposit at
// this cell - and that is what DepositField is.
