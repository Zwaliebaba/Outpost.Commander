// An order is the only input the simulation has (TechnicalDesign.md §4.7): a fixed-layout record
// of the seat, the tick it is for, the kind and up to four operands. Twenty kinds, under 32 bytes,
// and one byte layout on the wire, in the replay and in a snapshot's queue (ADR-003).
//
// THE OPERAND LAYOUT OF EVERY KIND (m1-vertical-slice/S2). An operand the table leaves blank is
// written zero and ignored. An order names ONE object: a selection of twelve devices is twelve
// orders, which is what keeps the record fixed-layout and the validation per object.
//
// An id operand is an ObjectId's value; where the kind may name more than one kind of object, a
// second operand carries the ObjectKind. A position is two operands, x then z, in subunits
// (1/256 of a world unit, Core/FixedPoint.h) - never in cells, so that an order is as precise as
// the simulation is. A cell position, where a kind wants one, is two operands of cell indices and
// says so.

// Chat's operand is an index into the message the client sent Net alongside: the simulation
// carries no text, because text is not state (ADR-002).
