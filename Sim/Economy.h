// The economy of GameDesign.md §4: deposit to extractor to generator, one currency, a stockpile
// with a cap that cannot be parked around, and the two army caps. Stage 2 of the tick
// (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8) and the arithmetic every other system calls when it spends.
//
// WHAT IS STATE AND WHAT IS DERIVED. The stockpile, the cap and the two counts live on the Seat,
// so the hash and the snapshot carry them. Everything this class holds - the deposit index and the
// service assignment - is a function of the landscape's definition and of the world, both of which
// are already hashed and already in the snapshot, so it is rebuilt rather than carried. That is
// what makes it safe for a rejoining client: it computes the same assignment from the same world.
//
// THE SERVICE ASSIGNMENT IS RECOMPUTED EVERY TICK. GameDesign.md §4 says a generator serves the
// four nearest unserved extractors, and the task's acceptance asks for it to be recomputed when a
// generator or extractor is completed or destroyed. Recomputing every tick satisfies that strictly
// and removes the whole class of bug where a system that changes a structure forgets to say so.
// The cost is bounded by the structure cap: a seat may hold 300 structures, so the worst case is
// on the order of 20,000 squared-distance tests a seat a tick, which is integer work an order of
// magnitude under the tick budget of TechnicalDesign.md §3. Caching it needs a profile that says
// so, and a stale assignment that two hosts agree on is a wrong economy rather than a desync,
// which is the harder bug of the two to find.
