// One commander's fog of war (TechnicalDesign.md §4.6; GameDesign.md §3): a viewer count and a
// state per cell. The host computes it and it is also the replication filter, so it is simulation
// state - in the hash, in the snapshot - rather than a thing the client works out for itself.
//
// EXPLORED IS NOT DERIVABLE FROM THE COUNT. A cell stays explored after its last viewer leaves, so
// the explored map is history and the count is the present; the two are stored side by side
// because neither can be computed from the other.
//
// THE COUNT IS A uint16 RATHER THAN THE BYTE THE TASK SPECIFIED, and the reason is the army caps.
// Allied seats share vision (GameDesign.md §2), an alliance may be all eight seats, and a seat may
// field 200 devices and 300 structures (§4), so 4,000 viewers can share one grid. A sight radius is
// 12 to 40 cells, so several hundred of them can hold one cell in view at a chokepoint, and a byte
// that saturated there could never be decremented back to zero: the cell would stay lit for the
// rest of the match. A fog that wrongly reveals is the worst failure this system has, and the
// second byte a cell costs buys it away outright. 65,535 is beyond 8 x 500 viewers, so it cannot
// be reached at all.
