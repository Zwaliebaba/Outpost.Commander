// Core's JSON reader and stops at the first file that fails, naming the file, the line and the
// column; a document is accepted whole or rejected whole, and a tree that fails leaves the
// ContentTree untouched.

// Loading is only half of it: ContentValidator checks what loading cannot, because a cross-file
// rule has no single file to blame until every file is in. OutpostHost --validate runs both, and
// so does the game before its first tick.
