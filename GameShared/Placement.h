// Where a structure may stand (GameDesign.md §5), as pure functions over the landscape, the world
// and the seat. Order validation asks before it accepts a PlaceStructure, and the construction
// system asks again before a builder begins one, because a site legal when it was planned may have
// been built over since.
//
// THE SLOPE RULE IS THE STEEPEST CELL UNDER THE FOOTPRINT, which is Landscape::Cell's
// slopePercent - the steepest step between two adjacent samples as a percentage of the spacing.
// The design says "the slope across the footprint is under 25%", and the other reading of that -
// the relief from the lowest sample to the highest over how far the footprint reaches - was built
// first and then measured against this one. Two things decided it.
//
// The number. 25 is the same number and the same unit GameData\Components.json gives Wheels for
// maxSlopePercent, and that one is read per cell (GameLogic/ClusterGraph.h). One figure written twice in
// one design means one unit.
//
// What each refuses. Over the 795 dry three-by-three sites of the built-in Small landscape, the
// average gradient puts 4 of them over 25% and the steepest cell puts 31 - so neither is anywhere
// near prohibitive, and the harshness this reading was first rejected for is 3.4% of the map. What
// the steepest cell refuses and the average waves through is a footprint straddling a CLIFF EDGE:
// eight gentle cells and one vertical one average out to nothing, and that is exactly the site a
// factory must not stand on. The reverse case does not exist, because ground that is uniformly
// steep enough to fail the average has every one of its cells steep too.
