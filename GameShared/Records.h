// The wire form of everything a client is told about (TechnicalDesign.md §5.3). Every record here
// is a plain aggregate of fixed-width integers (AGENTS.md R8) with a byte layout written down once
// in Records.cpp, and NetTests pins the bytes of one instance of each so that a layout change is a
// visible diff rather than a silent incompatibility.
//
// WHY THESE ARE NOT THE SIMULATION'S RECORDS. A Device is 80 bytes of simulation state and a
// DeviceState is 31 of what can be drawn: the wire carries what a client needs to render and to
// decide, and nothing it could use to see through the fog. The two are deliberately separate types
// rather than one type with a narrowing writer, because a field added to the simulation must not
// reach the wire by default - §5.2's leak posture is enforced by what the encoder can name.
//
// WHY THE LAYOUT IS NOT THE SNAPSHOT'S. Sim/Snapshot.cpp writes the same settings and the same
// landscape definition, and this file writes them again rather than calling into it. They are two
// streams with two versions: a snapshot that gains a field bumps SNAPSHOT_VERSION, and a wire that
// shared its writer would break every client of a host that could save. They also carry different
// payloads - a snapshot carries the landscape's flatten deltas and the wire must not, because the
// terrain under an unscouted base is not public (§5.2).
//
// NO FLOAT CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY, as §5.3 requires. Positions are quantised to a quarter of a
// world unit; angles are the high byte of a binary angle; everything else is already an integer.
