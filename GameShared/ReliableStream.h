// The one reliable stream in this protocol (TechnicalDesign.md §5.5): orders, client to host, with
// sequence numbers, a cumulative acknowledgement in every datagram, and a resend of anything still
// unacknowledged after a round-trip estimate. Frames are not carried here and never will be - a
// lost frame is answered by the next delta, and a retransmitted one would arrive after the frame
// that replaced it.
//
// ONE CLASS, BOTH ENDS. The sending half and the receiving half are here together because a
// conversation has one of each at both ends, and because the acknowledgement the receiving half
// produces is the acknowledgement the sending half consumes. The client sends orders and the host
// receives them today; nothing here knows which end it is.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE CALLER'S TICK, not wall time. Net is not the simulation and nothing here is
// hashed, but a tick is what both ends already count and a resend measured in ticks is a resend
// two machines describe the same way.
