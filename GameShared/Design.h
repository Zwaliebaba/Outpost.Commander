// What a commander designs and what a factory is building (GameDesign.md §6; m1-vertical-slice/S5).
//
// TWO SHAPES OF ONE IDEA, AND WHY BOTH EXIST. Content's DesignRecipe names its parts by id, because
// it is what the design screen commits and what is saved between matches (TechnicalDesign.md §9);
// Sim's DeviceDesign names them by row index, because a design is hashed and replicated every tick
// and a string is neither cheap nor fixed-layout. RecipeFor is the one conversion between them, so
// that the simulation derives its statistics from GameShared/DesignStats.cpp and not from a second
// implementation that can disagree with the design screen.
//
// NOTHING DERIVED IS STORED ON A DEVICE, and that is Device.h's rule rather than this task's
// preference. The task's acceptance says the statistics are "stored on the device at spawn", and
// its own next line asks that "an upgrade researched later changes fielded devices"; a stored
// maximum satisfies the first and breaks the second. What is stored is the CURRENT hit points,
// because damage is state, and what is derived is everything else - the maximum included. A
// retroactive upgrade then changes what a device can hold without walking the world, and S6's
// "hit points keeping their fraction" is the one rescale it does have to do.

// the numbers below are the owner's answer to OpenQuestions.md Q22 (2026-09-18), taken from the
// three curves that question put. The shape is the argument: the thresholds double, so a rank costs
// as much as every rank before it put together and the eighth is a thing a commander protects
// rather than a thing that happens; the percentages grow to 24, which is worth retreating and
// repairing for (GameDesign.md §8) and is well under the 60 a class upgrade can reach, so a veteran
// is an edge and not a second tier. Measured against nothing, which is what m2-skirmish is for: it
// ships ranks, and its AI-versus-AI matches are where the spread is measured.
