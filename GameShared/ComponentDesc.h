// (AGENTS.md R8) one row apiece, filled by ContentLoader from Content\Components.json. Every
// number is an integer in the unit its name says (AGENTS.md R6; ADR-002): hundredths for factors
// and percentages, ticks for times, subunits for distances, power in hundredths. Nothing here is
// a float, because Sim reads these rows and R16 forbids one.
//
// Hit points and damage are whole points, as the design tables write them; a rate that does not
// divide into the tick is held in hundredths per tick, so that the simulation accumulates it
// without a remainder it has to carry by hand.
