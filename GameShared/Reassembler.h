// Putting a fragmented frame back together (TechnicalDesign.md §5.3). The rule the design gives is
// the whole design: **a frame with a fragment missing is discarded**, not waited for and not asked
// for again. A frame is a delta against a baseline the client has acknowledged, so a frame that
// never completes costs one larger next frame and nothing else - and a retransmission would arrive
// after the frame it was meant to complete had been overtaken by a newer one anyway.
