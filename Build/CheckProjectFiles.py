"""Check the build shape, the project registries and the naming rules the compiler cannot (AGENTS.md §1-§3, §6; ADR-001).

    python3 Build/CheckProjectFiles.py --root <dir>   # another tree in the same shape

A finding is one line, `<file>:<line>: <rule>: <message>`, and any finding fails the run. The rules:

  solution-missing    the solution lists a project file that does not exist
  solution-unlisted   a .vcxproj in the tree is not in the solution (so CI would never build it)
  solution-directory  a project is not in a flat directory of its own name (Tests/<Name>Tests for a suite)
  platform            a configuration outside Debug/Release on x64/ARM64, or a condition naming one
  setting             a setting ADR-001 fixes is absent or has another value, in any configuration or platform
  alignment           Debug and Release differ, within a platform, outside the set AGENTS.md §3 enumerates
  include-directory   an include directory that is not $(SolutionDir)<AnotherProject>
  macro-family        a project defines a macro of the Windows family NeuronCore/WindowsHeader.h owns
  unregistered        a .cpp or .h in the project directory that the .vcxproj does not list
  missing             a listed file that does not exist
  filters             the .vcxproj and its .filters disagree, or the .filters is absent
  subdirectory        a C++ file in a subdirectory, where clang-tidy's header filter never looks
  compiled-shaders    CompiledShaders\\ listed as source; it is build output
  file-name           R7: a file that is not PascalCase.cpp or .h (the wizard's names excepted)
  shadow              a header named like a C runtime or SDK header, which an angled include of that name then finds first
  type-affix          R2: a class, struct or enum defined with a prefix or suffix
  spelling            R11: an identifier in the other half of a spelling family
  sdk-macro           an identifier spelled like a Windows SDK macro, which the preprocessor rewrites wherever <windows.h> is in scope
  tidy-regex          .clang-tidy's HeaderFilterRegex does not name exactly the projects the solution lists
  suite-empty         a *Tests project with no TEST_METHOD and no SuiteSmoke.cpp (vstest passes an empty suite)
  suite-stale         SuiteSmoke.cpp beside real tests; it is deleted when the first real test lands
  layering-unknown    a project the ADR-001 table in this script (BUILT_ON) has no row for; an edge is a decision
  edge-reference      a ProjectReference to a project ADR-001 does not build this one on
  edge-directory      an include directory naming a project ADR-001 does not build this one on
  edge-include        a quoted include resolving into a project ADR-001 does not build this one on
  include-missing     a quoted include resolving into a project whose directory is NOT on the include
                      path: the edge is legal and the plumbing is absent, so it compiles nowhere
  platform-header     a platform header included from Content, Sim, Net or Replica, which stay portable

Exit codes: 0 no finding; 1 at least one finding; 2 the tree could not be checked (no solution, or two).

Runs on Linux (python3) and Windows (python) with the standard library alone; the self-test is what
proves the rules fire, and it runs on either.
