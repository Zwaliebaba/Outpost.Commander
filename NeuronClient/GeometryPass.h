// The geometry pass (TechnicalDesign.md §6.4): every instance of the render view drawn from the
// shared model buffers, lit by the two directional lights the terrain pass already put in b0 and
// fogged over the same range, with the team-colour slot written unlit in the seat's colour.
//
// THE INSTANCES ARE GROUPED BY MODEL, IN ONE BUFFER PER FRAME IN FLIGHT. m1-vertical-slice/K1 asks
// for "one instance buffer per model per frame"; what it gets is one buffer per frame holding a
// contiguous RUN per model, and one DrawIndexedInstanced per run. That is the same batching - a
// draw per model, never a draw per instance - with one allocation and one map instead of a
// resource per model per frame. The grouping is a counting sort over the model index, so the order
// a run is drawn in does not depend on the order the render view happened to list its objects.
//
// THE BUFFER GROWS ON ITS OWN SLOT ONLY. GraphicsDevice::BeginFrame has already waited for the
// frame that last used this slot, so this slot's buffer is one the GPU has finished with and may be
// replaced; the other two slots may still be in flight and are left alone. Each slot therefore
// carries its own capacity and reaches the high-water mark on its own.
//
// WHAT THIS PASS DOES NOT DO. It does not cull: an instance is a few dozen triangles and M1 draws
// hundreds of them, so the frustum test would cost more list-building than it saves, and the number
// that would change that is the frame time G2's capture measures. It does not draw the rank badge
// of RenderInstance either - a badge is a textured quad and belongs with the UI pass, not with the
// lit geometry.
//
// THE PALETTE IS TAKEN ONCE AND THE INDEX IS RESOLVED HERE (Design/Interface.md §11 row 2;
// m1-vertical-slice/R2). A RenderInstance carries the commander's colour as an INDEX, not as a
// packed word: the eight colours are content (GameData\Interface.json, C6), and copying one into
// every instance of every frame is how the geometry and the minimap come to disagree about what
// seat 3 looks like. The pass holds the table for the life of the match and looks it up once per
// instance, which is the same work the caller was doing and one fewer place for it to be wrong.
//
// A WRECK WEARS ITS COMMANDER'S COLOUR LIKE ANYTHING ELSE. TechnicalDesign.md §6.2's table draws
// "every device, structure, feature and wreck" with "team colour substituted", so this pass does
// not read RenderInstanceKind at all; that distinction is picking's and the minimap's.
