// The interface's place in the input order (TechnicalDesign.md §6.5; Design/Interface.md §4): the
// router's FIRST sink, so that a click on a panel never also reaches selection or the camera.
//
// WHY A SINK AND NOT A CHECK IN THE GAME LOOP. NeuronClient/InputRouter.h already has the rule - each
// event goes to the sinks in order and the first to consume it ends the offer - and it masks the
// frame's polled view and the subscriptions to match. An interface that tested "is the pointer over
// a panel?" in the game's own code would have to repeat that masking in every place that reads
// input, and the places it forgot would be the bugs.
//
// IT OWNS THE ONE CLIENT-TO-AUTHORED CONVERSION IN THE INPUT PATH. Events carry client pixels
// (NeuronClient/InputEvent.h) and every rectangle in the interface is authored (§4), so the sink holds
// the current ScaledRectangle and runs AuthoredFromClient once per event. A pointer in the
// letterbox is over nothing at all and is not consumed.
