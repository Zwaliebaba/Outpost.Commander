// The UI pass's vertex half (Design/Interface.md §3; m1-vertical-slice/K3): a quad's corner in
// AUTHORED PIXELS turned into clip space, with no matrix and no camera. The interface is drawn at
// the authored resolution and never scaled (ADR-004), so the projection is a divide by the frame's
// size; a 4x4 orthographic matrix would be the same two numbers behind fourteen zeroes.
//
// THE MAPPING IS EXACT AND THAT IS THE POINT. A quad from x = 100 to x = 110 covers pixels 100 to
// 109 and no others, because Direct3D samples at the pixel centre and the rectangle is given by its
// edges. That is what makes a 16-texel glyph land on 16 pixels, one texel to one pixel, which §3
// requires of every layout in the document.
