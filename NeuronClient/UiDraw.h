// A panel turned into the quads that draw it (Design/Interface.md §3; m1-vertical-slice/K3). This
// is the whole of the look - the fills, the border, the title gradient, the button states, the bar
// colours and where every glyph lands - and it holds no Direct3D at all. NeuronClient/UiPass.h uploads
// what this produces and issues the draw.
//
// THE SPLIT IS WHAT MAKES THE LOOK TESTABLE. UiPass.h includes d3d12.h, so anything declared beside
// the pass can only be exercised where that header exists. The arithmetic here is the same kind
// UiLayout's is - rectangles, insets, thresholds - and it is the kind that is wrong by one pixel
// rather than wrong by a crash, which is exactly what a unit test catches and an eye does not. It
// is the same reason AUTHORED_WIDTH_PIXELS moved out of SceneTarget.h in this task.
//
// A COLOUR IS RGBA8 WITH RED IN THE LOW BYTE, which is NeuronCore/RenderView.h's PackedRgba8 - the one
// packing in the tree, and the byte order DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM reads a vertex attribute in.
//
// THE PALETTE IS THE GAME'S DATA AND THAT IS ALLOWED. Outpost::ChromePalette is Content's
// (GameData\Interface.json, m1-vertical-slice/C6) and Client is built on Content
// (TechnicalDesign.md §2), the same edge NeuronClient/ModelBuffers.h already uses for ModelDesc. What R9
// forbids is Client knowing Sim or Replica, and nothing here does.
