// A levelled log to a file under the user directory and, in Debug, to the debugger output
// (TechnicalDesign.md §9). Lines carry the simulation tick when the host has set one, else a
// wall-clock time of day; the host loop is the only caller of SetTick, so that the tick is the
// clock wherever there is one (AGENTS.md R16). Safe to call before any window exists and before
// Open, when only the debugger output receives the line. Lines end in CRLF, the Windows text
// convention, written in binary mode so that the file holds exactly the bytes written. Not
// thread-safe: the host thread of M1 gets its own log file.
