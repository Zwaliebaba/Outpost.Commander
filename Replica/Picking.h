// Turning a click into an object (Design/Interface.md §5; m1-vertical-slice/R2). Pure functions
// over a list of candidates and the camera's matrices, so that the executable holds no logic worth
// a test - which is this task's whole intent - and so that "a ray picks the nearer of two
// overlapping devices" is a case rather than something somebody checks by clicking.
//
// REPLICA HAS NO MATRIX TYPE AND MAY NOT HAVE ONE. It includes no Windows, Direct3D or WinRT header
// anywhere and Build/CheckProjectFiles.py refuses one (Replica/pch.h, ADR-001), so DirectXMath is
// out. Sixteen floats is the whole of what this needs, and the executable stores its XMMATRIX into
// them with XMStoreFloat4x4, which is where the row-major convention below comes from.
//
// THE UNPROJECTION IS HERE AND NOT IN THE EXECUTABLE. Turning a screen point into a world ray is
// exactly the kind of arithmetic that is wrong by a sign and right-looking on a symmetric camera;
// leaving it in the executable would put it where it cannot be tested, which is the thing this task
// exists to stop.
//
// WHAT MAY BE PICKED IS §5's RULE AND NOT THIS FILE'S OPINION. A click takes the nearest object of
// any seat - an enemy one is selected as an inspection - and the caller decides what to do with it.
// A rectangle takes DEVICES of one seat only: "a rectangle never selects structures and never
// selects another commander's anything". A wreck, a feature and a projectile are picked by nothing.
// A ray whose origin lands on a panel is refused before it is cast, and that is the caller's: the
// interface already knows where its panels are (Client/UiInputSink.h's PointerOverPanel).
