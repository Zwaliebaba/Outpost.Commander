//
// THIS IS THE FIRST FLOAT CONVERSION OF A SIMULATION NUMBER AND THE ONLY ONE. Everything upstream
// of Evaluate is an integer: the simulation's subunits, the wire's quarter-world-units, the binary
// angle's high byte, and the render time below. Evaluate is where they become the world units and
// radians the renderer wants, and nothing else in Replica or Client converts one.
//
// THE CLIENT HAS NO SIMULATION CLOCK (TechnicalDesign.md §3). It has the replica's timeline, which
// is the host's tick numbers arriving late, and a render time the caller names on that timeline.
// This file therefore holds no clock either: Evaluate is a pure function of two samples and a time,
// and the loop that draws decides what that time is.
