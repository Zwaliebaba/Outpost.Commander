# Outpost Commander — Technical Design

**Status: DESIGN (accepted by the owner on 2026-09-17, after the questions in [`OpenQuestions.md`](OpenQuestions.md) were answered; revised through ADRs; revised again on 2026-09-17 after an external review, whose six questions the owner answered the same day).** It assumes [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) has been read and cites its rules by number rather than repeating them. Decisions carry the date they were taken. Figures are arithmetic on stated assumptions, not measurements, and are labelled so: nothing in this repository has been built or run, and this document was written on Linux where nothing could be.

---

## 1. What the rules already decide

Four `AGENTS.md` rules shape everything below, and this document does not re-argue them:

- **R12** — Direct3D 12 only, COM lifetimes RAII, one scene target presented scaled.
- **R14** — the Windows SDK and the MSVC standard library, and nothing else. No Agility SDK, no `d3dx12.h`, no DirectXTK, no shader compiler at runtime, and no parser library: JSON, DDS and WAV are read by code in this tree.
- **R16** — the simulation is deterministic and holds no floats: integers and fixed point, a pinned PRNG, the tick as the only clock. Floats live in the renderer and in the client's replica.
- **§2** — flat project directories, one-way edges, project files as source.

**R13 was removed by the owner on 2026-09-17** (its number is not reused; `AGENTS.md` §5 says R18 and up are reserved without renumbering). The executable no longer ships alone: game data lives in files under `GameData\` beside it and mods override them (§8), and what the game writes goes under the user's profile (§9). Two things the old rule also said hold here as design: shaders are compiled at build time, never at runtime (`AGENTS.md` §2 still says so), and a path resolves from the executable's directory or the user's profile, never from the working directory (§8, §9).

What the rules leave open, and this document decides: the projects, the simulation's representation, the network model, the renderer's shape, the content layout, and where files live.

---

## 2. Projects and layers

Eight projects, one solution at the root, `x64` only, toolset `v145`, as `AGENTS.md` §3 requires. The names are decided (owner, 2026-09-17), and [`ADR-001`](ADR/ADR-001-solution-layout.md) records the layout as built (2026-09-17). Arrows point at what a project is built on; every arrow points downward and none points sideways.

    GameClient never names GameLogic and OutpostCommander never links it: the
    interest set of ADR-012 is a boundary the linker keeps (ADR-019). The two
    halves meet in exactly two places, both harnesses that never ship --
    Tests/IntegrationTests and OutpostCapture.
```

| Project | Kind | Namespace | Holds | Built on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NeuronCore` | static lib | `Neuron` | Fixed point, binary angles, integer geometry, the PRNG, hashing, slot maps, the byte stream, JSON, the DDS and WAV readers, bitmaps, logging, paths, the `Transport` seam and `LoopbackTransport`; and the aggregates the renderer consumes without knowing the game — `RenderView`, `HeightView`, `InterfaceDesc`, `ModelDesc` | — |
| `NeuronClient` | static lib | `Neuron` | The Direct3D 12 renderer, the seven passes, the scene target and swap chain, the camera, the input event system, the interface primitives and fonts, the scale rule; XAudio2; the Windows Runtime datagram transport, from M3 | `NeuronCore` |
| `NeuronServer` | static lib | `Neuron` | `TickPacer`, where wall time meets the tick and nowhere else (R16); the Winsock transport, from M3 | `NeuronCore` |
| `GameShared` | static lib | `Outpost` | The content tables and their loaders, the content hash and validation; the wire format — records, messages, fragmentation, reassembly, the reliable stream; and the vocabulary both sides agree on: object ids, orders, designs, devices, structures, deposits, plans, features, seats, the fog grid, the landscape and its generator, `VictoryState` | `NeuronCore` |
| `GameClient` | static lib | `Outpost` | The client's world: the objects its commander can see, built from the records, interpolated between frames and turned into the render view; selection, picking, order input, the placement preview; the client endpoint | `NeuronCore`, `GameShared` |
| `GameLogic` | static lib | `Outpost` | The simulation entire — the world, orders and their validation, economy, research, production, movement and pathing, visibility, combat, the AI, the tick, the hash, snapshots; the host endpoint, the interest set, the client history the encoder keeps | `NeuronCore`, `GameShared` |
| `OutpostCommander` | exe, **packaged UWP** | `Outpost` | The game: the framework view, the core window, the frame loop, the package's two directories. Windows Runtime glue and nothing else (R20) | `NeuronCore`, `NeuronClient`, `GameShared`, `GameClient` |
| `OutpostHost` | exe, console | `Outpost` | The headless host: opens a match, runs the one simulation, publishes to clients | `NeuronCore`, `NeuronServer`, `GameShared`, `GameLogic` |
| `OutpostCapture` | exe, console | `Outpost` | The headless capture CI drives: a scripted match, client and host in one process over `LoopbackTransport`, a frame written every hundredth tick. A harness; it never ships | everything |

**The edges, and why each runs the way it does.**

- **The split is by layer and by side, and both halves of that matter** ([`ADR-018`](ADR/ADR-018-client-server-libraries.md)). The layer keeps the engine ignorant of the game (`AGENTS.md` R9); the side keeps the client ignorant of the simulation, which is the older and sharper rule — only the host simulates (owner, 2026-09-17), and now only the host *links* the code that does.
- **`GameShared` holds nothing that decides anything.** The tables, the wire format, and the vocabulary a record is written in: an object id, an order, a design, a device's state, a structure, a deposit, a plan, the fog grid, the landscape. If a header there starts answering a question about a match rather than describing one, it belongs in `GameLogic`.
- **`GameLogic` includes no Windows header, no D3D header and no socket.** That is what makes a headless host possible and the simulation testable without a window, and it is the edge the layering checker gates on (`Build/CheckProjectFiles.py`). `GameShared` and `GameClient` are held to the same rule.
- **`GameClient` builds on `GameShared` and on nothing above it.** It is the second world model this design has: the objects its commander can see, built from the records, interpolated, and turned into a render view. **It does not build on `NeuronClient`** — the render view and height view are aggregates in `NeuronCore`, so the replica produces them and the renderer consumes them with no edge between the two. That property came from [`ADR-001`](ADR/ADR-001-solution-layout.md) and is kept deliberately.
- **`NeuronClient` builds on `NeuronCore` alone.** `ADR-001`'s table let it build on `GameShared`, and three of its headers took the offer — which was an R9 break nobody had noticed until the layering table refused it. The two aggregates the renderer actually wanted, `InterfaceDesc` and `ModelDesc`, are in `NeuronCore` now; the renderer names no game concept at all.
- **The executables hold what is genuinely theirs, and `OutpostCommander` holds less than that.** The packaged executable is Windows Runtime glue — the view source, the framework view, the event subscriptions, the package's two directories — and nothing a suite could have covered (`AGENTS.md` R20). The frame assembly, the camera controller and the HUD live in `GameClient` for exactly the reason `NeuronClient/PointerMode.h` gives about the sign of an aim delta.
- **Two projects see both sides and neither ships**: `Tests/IntegrationTests`, because the split leaves no library above both halves and the three tests that prove they agree have nowhere else to live; and `OutpostCapture`, because a scripted match needs a host and a client in one process. Both are written into the layering table by hand, so that "everything" is a decision rather than a habit.

**Namespaces** (owner, 2026-09-17): `Outpost` for the game, as `AGENTS.md` §1 illustrates; **`Neuron` for the engine**, so that the input, transport and XAudio2 code ported from Species moves without a rename, which `AGENTS.md` names as the reason the formatter settings were carried over. The transport seam lives in `NeuronCore` and its two socket implementations in `NeuronClient` and `NeuronServer`, all of them engine code; the protocol above them is game code, which is why the wire format is `GameShared` and the two endpoints are `GameClient` and `GameLogic`, all in `Outpost`.

**Tests** are one `Tests/<Name>Tests` project per static library on the Microsoft Native Unit Test Framework, each sitting directly above its library with the same edges, **and one more**: `Tests/IntegrationTests`, the only suite allowed to see both sides, which is why it is the one row in the layering table written by hand rather than derived from a library's name. `GameShared`, `GameClient` and `GameLogic` test without a window; `NeuronClientTests` and `IntegrationTests` link `d3d12.lib` and `dxgi.lib` because what they cover does.

**`Build/` and `Tools/`** hold Python that never ships: the three checkers `AGENTS.md` §6 names, a layering checker in the Species mould (an upward include fails, and there is no allowlist), the landscape tool of §4.4, the cost-efficiency script of `GameDesign.md` §8, and the importers of §8.

## 3. The frame and the tick

**The simulation ticks at 20 Hz** (owner, 2026-09-17), 50 ms each, recorded in ADR-002, with the empty tick measured there now and the full tick by `m1-vertical-slice/G3`. Species inherited 10 Hz from Darwinia and spread heavy work over ten slices; twenty is chosen because orders feel late at 100 ms of tick quantisation on top of the replication interval, and because a 50 ms budget on a 2026 desktop for the object counts below is generous.

**Only the host simulates, and only the host's process holds a simulation at all.** There are two loops in two processes on two machines ([`ADR-019`](ADR/ADR-019-the-client-never-simulates.md), 2026-09-20). Until then a single-player game ran both in one process, from M1 (owner, 2026-09-17); it no longer can, and the only thing that still runs both is `OutpostCapture`, a harness that never ships:

```
host loop (OutpostHost, on its own machine; or both loops inside OutpostCapture), driven by wall time:
1  drain the network: orders in, acks in
2  while simulation time trails wall time by a tick:
       apply this tick's orders; Sim::Advance(tick)              0, 1 or several per pass
3  every second tick: publish a frame to each client            each client's interest set, delta-encoded (§5)
4  heartbeat, timeouts, the host log

client loop (OutpostCommander), driven by the display:
1  pump the window's messages into the input event queue        once per frame, nowhere else
2  drain the network: frames in, orders and acks out
3  apply new frames to the replica
4  interpolate the replica 100 ms behind the newest frame       the first float: positions between two frames
5  build the render view from the replica
6  route input events: UI first, then camera and selection      selection and orders become messages
7  record, draw, present
```

Step 2 of the host loop is the only place wall time and ticks meet (R16). The client has no simulation clock; it has the replica's timeline, which is the host's tick numbers arriving late. **Local play is a host thread in the same process talking to the client through the loopback transport**, so single-player exercises the same code path as a match over the network; nothing is special-cased for one player. **A host that falls behind** — more objects than the machine can advance in real time — slows the match clock rather than skipping: it reduces ticks per wall second until it catches up, tells every client, and the lobby shows it, because a skipped tick would be a different match. **What a click costs in time**: up to 50 ms for the next tick on the host, plus over the network up to 100 ms for the next publish, 100 ms of interpolation and the round trip — 250 to 330 ms from click to visible movement at broadband latencies, against 150 ms in the lockstep draft. Over loopback only the round trip vanishes: single-player carries the same 250 ms, because nothing is special-cased for one player, and the 100 ms of interpolation is the knob to turn if the slice says that is too much.

**Budget arithmetic.** Eight commanders at the caps of `GameDesign.md` §4 — 200 devices and 300 structures each — is 4,000 objects; with projectiles and a neutral faction, call it 5,000 simulated objects. At 50 ms per tick that is 10 µs per object per tick, which is thousands of instructions. Pathing and visibility are the systems that can spend it (§4.5, §4.6); publishing (§5) is the third, and it runs every other tick.

---

## 4. The simulation

Everything in `Sim`, in the order R16 forces. It runs on the host only, and everything in it is exactly as deterministic as before the network model was decided: determinism now serves replays, saves, tests and the AI rather than agreement between clients, and R16 stands.

### 4.1 Numbers

| Quantity | Representation | Range | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Position (x, z) | `std::int32_t` in 1/256 world unit | ±8.3 million world units | A Frontier landscape is 65,536 across; the range is not the constraint, the arithmetic is |
| Height (y) | `std::int32_t`, same unit | | Terrain samples and object heights share it |
| Velocity | position units per tick | | No per-second quantity ever enters the simulation; the tick is the unit |
| Angle | `std::uint16_t` binary angle | 65,536 per turn | `sin` and `cos` from a 1,024-entry integer table with linear interpolation, in `NeuronCore` |
| Distance | integer square root of the squared distance | | Compare squared distances wherever possible; take the root only where a range check needs it |
| Percentages, multipliers | `std::int32_t` hundredths | | `armorPercent`, `speedFactorHundredths` — the unit in the name (R6) |
| Time | ticks, `std::uint32_t` | 6.8 years at 20 Hz | Build times, cooldowns and research durations are tick counts in the tables |

The 1/256 subunit is chosen so that a cell of 64 world units is 16,384 subunits and cell arithmetic is a shift, and so that the slowest interesting speed — a heavy on tracks at 20 world units per second, a third of the Species `Armour` — is 256 subunits per tick, with room to scale by hundredths without rounding to zero. **A product of two positions overflows `int32`**: every such product is done in `std::int64_t`, and `NeuronCore` provides the fixed-point helpers (`MulDiv`, `Sqrt`, `Dot`, `LengthSquared`) so nobody writes the widening by hand twice.

### 4.2 Randomness

Two streams, named, in the Species manner, because Species spent a task finding six places that drew simulation state from the cosmetic one:

- **The simulation stream**, seeded from the match seed and advanced only by the simulation, in a fixed order. One generator per match, not per system; a per-system generator would be deterministic too, but it would make "how many draws happened this tick" a question nobody can answer.
- **The cosmetic stream**, for particles, jitter and sound variation, seeded from anything and never read by `Sim` — enforced by the layering: it lives in `Client`.

The generator is a small, well-known algorithm written into `NeuronCore` from its specification. xoshiro128\*\* is the choice: sixteen bytes of state, and its reference implementation is public domain, so R14's "the licence travels with the bytes" has nothing to carry. Mersenne Twister, which Species carries, is 2.5 KB of state that would go into every snapshot for no benefit.

### 4.3 Identity and storage

**An object's identity is a generated id, never a container index.** Species' owner recorded exactly this decision for Species' own future protocol on 2026-08-02 (the Species repository's `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, *Runtime model*): a slot index is reused, so a stale reference silently aliases whatever occupies the slot later; a counter incremented in creation order can never alias. Here it is the rule from the first line, and it is also what the wire carries: an `ObjectId` is a `std::uint32_t` creation counter paired with a kind tag, the same on the host and in every replica. A slot map in `NeuronCore` resolves it to storage in O(1) through a generation-checked handle, so a dead id resolves to nothing rather than to a stranger.

**Storage is a slot map per object kind** — devices, structures, projectiles, features, wrecks — with stable handles and **iteration in id order**. Standard containers by default (R15): a `std::vector` behind the slot map, and never a `std::unordered_map` in a loop whose order reaches the outcome (R16). Per-commander state — power, research, designs, visibility — is an array indexed by seat.

### 4.4 The landscape

**Heights are generated, integer, and identical everywhere.** The Species generator — diamond-square tiles with a fractal dimension, height scale and desired height each, merged into one map and smoothed under a guide grid; [`SpeciesTerrain.md`](SpeciesTerrain.md) §4 has every step — is ported from the Species repository's `GameLogic/Landscape.cpp` into integer arithmetic on the simulation stream. The Species code draws from the cosmetic LCG and computes its noise as `sfrand(powf(length × 10, fractalDimension))` in `float`; that is exactly what R16 forbids, and it is why Species records a landscape that changed shape across a compiler migration. The port replaces `powf` with a fixed-point table over the handful of fractal dimensions a landscape may use, and the LCG with the simulation stream keyed by tile seed. **The heightfield is simulation state**: pathing, slope, water and line of sight all read it, so it is under R16 without exception. The palette lookup that colours it (§6.4) is not, and stays in float on the renderer side. **Generation depends on nothing but the definition**: the Species preference that changed the heightmap's resolution (`SpeciesTerrain.md` §3) is the bug this port does not carry. **The generator is tuned by a tool before it is trusted**: a Python port of the same integer algorithm under `Tools/` runs a hundred seeds per size class and reports slope histograms per drive class, flood-fill connectivity between starts, the count of buildable footprints near each start and a palette rendering, against the guarantees `GameDesign.md` §3 makes; the recipe that turns a seed into a tile list is what that tool tunes, and it is the first deliverable of M0's landscape task.

The client generates the same landscape from the definition the host sends at join, with the same `Sim` code — the client executable links `Sim` because it hosts locally — and receives the flatten deltas as they happen. A landscape is therefore never replicated sample by sample.

**Storage.** Heights are sampled every 16 world units — four samples per cell edge, close to the Species spacing of 10.66 — and stored as `std::int16_t` whole units, which covers the height range of any Species landscape many times over. A Large landscape is 2,049 × 2,049 samples, 8.4 MB; a Frontier one 4,097 × 4,097, 33.6 MB. Derived grids are per cell, not per sample: slope class, water and obstruction at a byte or a bit each, and per-commander visibility at one byte of viewer count (§4.6) plus two bits of state. Eight commanders on a Frontier landscape is 8 × 1.05 million cells × 1.25 bytes = 10.5 MB of visibility. Arithmetic, not measurement.

**Every figure above is O(area), and a landscape ten times a Frontier one *on the side* is a design target** (owner, 2026-09-18, `OpenQuestions.md` Q19): 10,240 cells, 655,360 world units, 40,961 samples across, a hundred times the area. That is **3.36 GB of heights**, 419.4 MB of cell grid and 1.05 GB of visibility for eight commanders — **4.82 GB of simulation state before anything is drawn**, against 48.3 MB on Frontier — and 409,600 clusters against the 4,096 §4.5 sizes the cluster graph for. **None of the three survives as a dense array over the whole map, and the shape of the answer is the same for all three: tiled, with ground no commander has reached costing nothing.** It is a larger wall than the renderer's, which ADR-007 answers with a quadtree. A landscape is generated from a seed and a tile list, so heights are a pure function of a few hundred bytes and could be produced per region rather than stored per map; whether that is cheap enough for the simulation's random access is `m4-frontier/T1`'s to measure. What does hold at that size: positions, because ADR-002's `std::int32_t` at 1/256 of a world unit spans ten times a Frontier side with 12.8× to spare, and the state hash, because it covers the definition and never the heightfield.

**Stamps** are authored patches: a rectangle of relative heights and a list of features, applied after generation at a position the generator chooses. Their format is the same as a snapshot's landscape section, so the tool that authors one is the game with an editor window, and a stamp is a JSON file under `GameData\Stamps` (§8). **Terrain deltas at runtime** — flatten under a structure, and nothing else through M3 (owner, 2026-09-17) — are recorded as a list of rectangular height edits applied over the generated base, so a snapshot carries the seed plus the deltas rather than the heights, and terraforming can come later without a new snapshot format.

### 4.5 Pathing

The system that decides whether a Large landscape works. The design is **hierarchical A\* over clusters with local steering**:

- The landscape is divided into 16×16-cell clusters; each cluster's boundary crossings are nodes, and the paths between them inside the cluster are precomputed edges, per drive class, because water and slope differ per class. A Large landscape has 1,024 clusters; a Frontier one 4,096.
- A move order plans over the cluster graph (thousands of nodes, not millions of cells), refines the first few clusters to a cell path, and refines further as the device advances. Planning is amortised over ticks with a budget per tick, and it is deterministic because the budget is in nodes expanded, not in milliseconds.
- Between cells, devices steer around each other with a separation rule in integer arithmetic; formations are a version-2 concern.
- A structure placed or destroyed invalidates the clusters it touches, which recompute their internal edges lazily. Plans and wrecks obstruct nothing — only structures under construction or standing do — so a battle does not churn the clusters and a loser cannot grief the pathfinder with placements.

Flow fields — one field per destination, shared by every device heading there — are the alternative and are better for hundred-unit blobs converging on one point; they are worse for a landscape this size because a field covers the map. The choice is an ADR when the slice has numbers; the interface `Sim` exposes (request a path, advance along it) is the same for both.

### 4.6 Visibility

Per commander, a grid of the three fog states. Each tick, a budgeted share of the devices and structures with sight recompute the cells they see: a disc of the sight radius, extended by the height difference, with each cell tested for occlusion by walking the heightfield from the viewer to the cell in integer steps. A viewer that has not moved and whose surroundings have not changed keeps its previous disc. The budget — every viewer refreshes at least once per second — is in viewers per tick, so it is deterministic.

Every device and structure with sight is a viewer — up to 4,000 at the budget of §3 — and the refresh budget is 200 viewers per tick, moved viewers first, so every viewer refreshes at least once per second. A refresh of a 24-cell radius is a disc of about 1,800 cells with an average occlusion walk of 12 steps, roughly 22,000 heightfield reads, so the budget costs 4.4 million reads per tick, local to each viewer's neighbourhood rather than random over the heightfield; it is the largest single cost in the tick and the first thing ADR-002's full-tick measurement records. The grid holds, per commander and cell, a viewer count of one byte, so that a moved viewer's old disc can be un-seen, and the two-bit fog state derived from it.

**The grid is dense and O(area), which the design target of §4.4 does not allow**: eight commanders on a landscape ten times a Frontier side is 1.05 GB, against 10.5 MB on Frontier. It is the easiest of the three area terms to fix, because most of a landscape that size is never explored by anyone: held in tiles allocated on first sight, a commander who has seen a twentieth of it costs 6.6 MB rather than 131. **The per-tick cost does not change and is the point worth keeping**: the refresh budget above is in viewers, and viewers scale with the device cap of §3, not with the map, so a landscape a hundred times the area costs the same per tick as Frontier does.

**The host also keeps, per seat, a ghost store**: the last-seen record of every structure that seat has ever seen, which is what a client's explored-but-not-visible map shows, what an attack on an unseen target is redirected to, and what a rejoining client gets back; it is part of the snapshot (§4.9).

**Visibility is also the replication filter.** What a commander's grid marks visible is what the host publishes to that commander's client (§5.2), so the fog of war is enforced by the host and a client is never sent what it should not see.

### 4.7 Orders and validation

**Orders are the only input.** An order is a small, fixed-layout record: the commander's seat, the tick it is for, the kind, and up to four operands (ids, a position, a design id, a research id). Kinds: `Move`, `AttackMove`, `Attack`, `Patrol`, `Guard`, `Stop`, `ReturnToRepair`, `SetStance`, `PlaceStructure`, `CancelStructure`, `Demolish`, `BuildModule`, `SetProduction`, `CancelProduction`, `SetResearch`, `CancelResearch`, `SaveDesign`, `Group`, `Surrender`, `Chat`. Twenty kinds, every one under 32 bytes.

**The simulation validates every order** against what the seat owns, can see and can afford, and drops what fails with a reason the client can display: `GameLogic/OrderValidation.h`'s `RejectReason` is that vocabulary — `NotOwned`, `NotVisible`, `CannotAfford`, `AtCap`, `InvalidTarget`, `InvalidPlacement`, `NotResearched`, `NoCommandPost`, `Malformed` — and a seat carries the orders its own tick refused, in the order they were judged, for Net to report. Validation is one function, so a system arriving later adds its kind's rules there rather than in its own stage, and `GameShared/Order.h` carries the operand layout of every one of the twenty kinds. One rewrite rather than a rejection: an `Attack` on a target the seat cannot see becomes an `AttackMove` to the target's last known position from the ghost store (`GameDesign.md` §8), or is refused `NotVisible` when there is no record of it. Validation is inside `Sim`, on the host, and it is the whole of the trust model: a client's order is a request, and a client that lies about what it sees gains nothing, because the host decides visibility (§4.6) and applies orders against its own state.

### 4.8 Tick order

Fixed, and written down once:

```
1   apply this tick's orders, in seat order then arrival order
2   economy: extraction, stockpile, caps
3   research: advance, complete, apply upgrades
4   production: factories advance, spawn devices
5   construction: builders advance structures and modules
6   movement: paths advance, steering, collision with terrain and obstruction
7   visibility: the budgeted refresh
8   targeting and firing: acquire, roll, spawn projectiles, resolve direct hits
9   projectiles: advance, resolve indirect impacts, splash
10  damage, destruction, wrecks, experience
11  AI seats: observe, decide, enqueue orders for tick t + delay
12  victory check
13  hash the state
14  every second tick: publish (§5)
```

Step 11 is why the AI is in `GameLogic`: it emits orders like any commander, into the same queue, for a future tick, so a replay reproduces every AI decision without recording one. Step 14 is outside the simulation proper — it reads the state and writes nothing — and lives in `GameLogic` beside the host endpoint.

### 4.9 Hash, snapshot, replay

- **The hash** in step 13 is a 64-bit digest over every object's simulation fields in id order plus every seat's state, each tick. FNV-1a is enough and is a few lines in `NeuronCore`. It is what a test compares between two runs and what a replay is checked against; there is no cross-client comparison, because no client simulates.
- **A snapshot** is the full serialisation of `Sim` — seed, tick, landscape deltas, every slot map, every seat and its ghost store, the PRNG state, and the planning queue — through one versioned byte-stream writer and reader pair in `NeuronCore`. The planning queue is there because a device that is walking a route must go on walking the *same* route from the *same* tick: a route is a pure function of the graph and the request, but the tick a half-finished search lands on is not, so the queue carries each request and the route it has reached, and a search still in flight is replayed for the nodes it had already spent rather than restarted (§4.5). Obstruction and the cluster graph are the other way about — both are functions of the standing structures, so both are rebuilt on load rather than carried. It is the save file, and it is host-side only: a client never holds the whole match, and a joining or rejoining client receives its commander's view (§5.4), not a snapshot. Estimated size: 5,000 objects at about 64 bytes, plus per-commander grids compressed as runs, under 2 MB for a Large landscape.
- **A replay** is the settings, the seed and the order stream the host applied. The stream is tiny (§5.7), so the host records every match; a replay is watched by hosting it locally from the file, which is why the client executable links `Sim`.

## 5. Networking

### 5.1 The model, and the decision behind it

**Decided (owner, 2026-09-17): the host runs the only simulation and replicates state to clients.** Each client holds a replica of the objects its commander can see, kept current by frames the host publishes at 10 Hz; orders go to the host and take effect there. The draft had recommended deterministic lockstep, and the owner chose replication over it; both sides of that are recorded here so nobody re-litigates it.

**What it buys.** A client receives only what its commander can see, so the fog of war is enforced by the host and a modified client sees exactly what an honest one does — the map hack that every lockstep RTS lives with does not exist. Clients need not be deterministic, identical, or even the same build of the simulation, and a headless host on a machine nobody plays on is the natural shape rather than a special case, which is what "server-ready" (owner, 2026-09-17) needs. Late join and rejoin are the same thing as joining, and there is no desync class of bugs, because there is nothing for two simulations to disagree about.

**What it costs.** A protocol that publishes state rather than orders (§5.3); interest management, which is the visibility grid doing double duty (§5.2); a second world model, `Replica`, that has to stay a faithful reading of the host's (§2); bandwidth an order of magnitude above lockstep's, though still small (§5.7); and orders that take a round trip before a unit moves (§5.5). The lockstep draft had none of these and a desync class instead. The cost is accepted and the design carries it.

**What stays.** R16 stands: the host's simulation is deterministic so that replays reproduce, saves round-trip, tests compare hashes and the AI is reproducible. The Species transport work is ported as before (§5.6).

### 5.2 Interest: what a client is told

A client's **interest set** is decided by the host every publish, per client, from the visibility grid of §4.6:

- every object in a cell its commander, or an ally, currently sees;
- every object its commander owns, wherever it is;
- structures in explored cells at their **last-seen state**, from the seat's ghost store (§4.6) — sent when they leave visibility and again when seen again — which is how a client draws the ghost of a base it scouted and how a rejoining client gets its scouting back;
- the landscape's definition and the match settings, which every client holds in full: the seed, the size class, the tile list and the stamp placements are not secrets, and deposits and start positions are known to every commander from the first tick, as in most strategy games. **Flatten deltas are not**: a structure's footprint reaches a client only inside the structure's own record or ghost, so the terrain under an unseen enemy base stays as the generator made it until the base is scouted. That the definition is public is the one leak this model keeps, and it is named here rather than hidden.

An object entering the set is sent whole; an object leaving it is sent as a removal, and the replica keeps a ghost only for structures. Projectiles and effects inside the set are sent as short-lived events rather than objects. Interest is recomputed every publish from the grid, so the cost is a walk over the commander's visible cells' occupants, which the visibility pass already maintains.

### 5.3 Frames: how state travels

The host publishes a **frame** per client every second tick (10 Hz): a sequence number, the sequence of the **baseline** it is encoded against, and three lists — objects created since the baseline (full records), objects changed (a field mask and the changed fields), objects removed — plus the events of the interval. The baseline is the newest frame the client has acknowledged; the host keeps a short history of what it sent each client (32 frames, 3.2 seconds) and encodes against the acked one, so **a lost frame costs nothing but a larger next frame**: no retransmission, no ordering, just the next delta from an older baseline. A client whose acknowledged baseline has fallen out of the history receives a full frame — the same path a joining client takes.

Records are the plain aggregates of `GameShared`: `DeviceState` (id, design, seat, position, heading, hit points, rank, order kind, target, stance flags), `StructureState`, `WreckState`, `FeatureState`, `SeatState` (power, research in progress, **the research already complete as one bit a row**, victory state, the caps, and the seat's last refused order), and `Event` (kind, position, source, target, time). Positions on the wire are quantised to a quarter of a world unit and sent as deltas from the baseline; a device that did not move sends nothing. Every field is a fixed-width integer — an id is the four-byte counter of §4.3, hit points two bytes, a position delta six — and there is no float on the wire. A design's parts travel as a `DesignState` record with the first device of that design a client sees, so a client can show what it is fighting. A `FogDelta` record carries the changes to the commander's own fog grid — runs of cells with their new state — because the fog pass and the minimap draw the commander's visibility and nothing else in the frame says what it is; it is the commander's own information and leaks nothing (added 2026-09-17 by the implementation plan, `ImplementationPlan.md` §6). **A frame larger than a datagram** — 1,200 bytes of payload, under every common path MTU — is split into numbered fragments; the client applies a frame only when every fragment has arrived and discards one with a fragment missing, which costs nothing but a larger next delta. **A destruction event carries no geometry.** Its `source` is the id of the thing that died, and a client already holds that object's last `DeviceState` or `StructureState` — model, position, heading, seat — from the frame before, which is everything the Debris pass of §6.2 needs to shatter the right model at the right place. The replica therefore keeps a removed object's last state until the end of the frame that reports its death, and the wire gains an event kind rather than a record. It also means an explosion is fog-correct for free: interest (§5.2) sends a client only what its commander can see, so a death it cannot see produces no event and no debris, and the renderer never has to be told not to draw one.

**Two details the records were built with** (`m1-vertical-slice/N1`, 2026-09-19). A device's primary order and its four stances travel as **one byte, mixed radix rather than bit fields**: seven orders times three fire, two range, three retreat and two movement stances is 252 of a byte's 256 values, where the same five packed as bit fields need nine bits — and that one byte is what makes the fourteen-byte changed record of §5.7 fit, so the bandwidth arithmetic above rests on it. The four values no combination produces are refused on read, which is how a hostile byte is stopped from naming an order the enumeration does not have. And `StructureState` is the wire record named above, so the simulation's own lifecycle enumeration is `StructurePhase` (`GameShared/Structure.h`): one namespace cannot hold both, and the wire record is the one this document names.

**An event is the one thing in a frame that a dropped frame would otherwise lose, so the host holds it until it is acknowledged** (`m1-vertical-slice/C9`, 2026-09-19). Every other list in a frame is a statement about NOW — these are the objects you can see, this is what changed since your baseline — so the next delta catches a client up whatever it missed. An event is a statement about a MOMENT, and the tick it happened in is over. Measured on a real loopback match, the client applied 105 frames and skipped 360 — 77% — because the publish outruns the acknowledgement, which is the ordinary case and not a lossy link; an event sent once was therefore lost three times out of four. So each client's view keeps a **queue of the events it has been sent and not acknowledged**, every publish sends the whole queue, and an acknowledgement drops from the front exactly what the acknowledged frame carried. The queue is bounded at 256 and the oldest go, because a client that has stopped acknowledging must not grow it without end. **And the frame says where its events sit in that stream** — `firstEvent`, the running count of the ones before the first of them — because the host resends until it hears back and a client that applies two frames before its acknowledgement arrives would otherwise draw one trigger pull as two muzzle flashes; the client keeps its own count and takes the part it has not seen. A commander who REJOINS is sent none of them: the full frame that follows catches his state up, which is what a rejoin is for, but a burst of muzzle flashes from shots fired while he was gone is not.

**Shots are the only event kind M1 produces** (owner's ruling, 2026-09-19). Direct fire leaves no other trace in the simulation at all — the hit is decided at the trigger and no projectile is kept — so `Sim` records every trigger pull in a list that lives for the tick that pulled it (`Sim::Shots()`), and the host loop turns it into events. Impacts and deaths are M2's; the channel they will travel is this one.

Datagrams carry frames unreliably. Orders (§5.5) are the one reliable stream.

**What `m1-vertical-slice/N2` had to settle, recorded in [`ADR-012`](ADR/ADR-012-replication-protocol.md) with the measurements.** The
history is **32 frames** a client, 3.2 seconds: a client that has acknowledged nothing for longer has lost thirty consecutive datagrams,
which is a link that is down. A fragment carries **1,189 bytes** — the datagram payload less the Fragment header — and a frame needs at
most 64 of them. And the acknowledgement rides every datagram the client sends, with one addition §5.3 does not have: **a frame the client
DISCARDS forces another acknowledgement**, because a discarded frame is evidence the host is encoding against a baseline the client has
already moved past, and without it a single lost acknowledgement leaves the two encoding and discarding past each other until the next
heartbeat. Measured on 2026-09-19: a full frame at 600 visible objects is 19,153 bytes and a delta with half of them moving is 3,387 —
a fifth under §5.7's arithmetic below, because a device that did not move sends nothing at all.

### 5.4 Joining, leaving, resuming

- **Join**: protocol version, content hash, player name, join token. The host answers with a seat, the settings, the landscape definition, the current tick and a full frame, or a refusal with a reason (version, content hash, no seat).
- **Rejoin** is a join with the same token; the seat is returned from AI control and the client receives a full frame.
- **Leave** and **timeout** put the seat under AI control for the grace period `GameDesign.md` §10 gives.
- **Save and resume** are host-side: the host writes a snapshot (§4.9) and later loads it, and the players join as they would any match.
- **Observe** is a join that names a seat to WATCH rather than asking for one to play (`m1-vertical-slice/G2`, owner's ruling of 2026-09-19). The seat must exist in the match and must be one **no human owns** — the rule is on the seat's kind, not on whether a client is connected to it, because a human's seat is still his while his rejoin grace runs — and the refusal is the ordinary `no seat`. An observer receives that seat's frames through the same interest and fog path a player does, so it sees exactly what that commander sees and no more; its orders are refused before they reach stage 1, with `not owned`, which is simply true of a client watching somebody else's commander. **It is not the seat.** It is not what the host hands the next joiner, not what the host reports as the seat's state, and its going quiet is not a commander dropping to AI: nothing waits for an observer, so it is let go rather than held. What it exists for first is the capture of §10 — a match of two scripted commanders has no client, and a renderer draws a replica that only a client fills — and M3's spectator is the same connection.

### 5.5 Orders and their feel

Orders travel client to host on a **reliable stream**: sequence numbers, cumulative acknowledgements in every datagram, and resend of anything unacknowledged after a round-trip estimate. The host applies an order at the start of the next tick and it shows in the following frame. From click to visible movement is 250 to 330 ms at broadband latencies (§3), about twice the input delay the lockstep draft carried; the client acknowledges an order locally at once — a cursor mark, a sound — and the unit moves when the replica says it has. There is no client-side prediction of movement: a strategy game does not need it and the replica stays honest.

### 5.6 The transport

UDP, one socket per process, ported from the Species `network-transport` work rather than reinvented: a `Transport` seam with a `UdpTransport` and a `LoopbackTransport` so the whole conversation is testable in-process; every datagram framed with a protocol version and a length, every read bounded; server-assigned connection ids so two players behind one router are two players; liveness by heartbeat and timeout. It lives in `NeuronCore` (§2).

### 5.7 Bandwidth, as arithmetic

Take a client whose commander sees 600 objects in a large battle, 300 of which change between frames. A changed device record is 4 bytes of id, 6 of position delta, 1 of heading, 2 of hit points, 1 of flags: 14 bytes, so 4.2 KB per frame — four fragments — and 42 KB/s at 10 Hz. Creations are about 40 bytes each and events 8; a full frame of 600 objects is about 24 KB, twenty fragments. Peak is therefore 30–70 KB/s per client and about 0.6 MB/s out of a host with eight, against under 2 KB/s per client for the lockstep draft: thirty times more, and still trivial on a LAN or a broadband link. A replay of a two-hour match is under 4 MB, unchanged, because it is orders. Arithmetic, not measurement; [`ADR-012`](ADR/ADR-012-replication-protocol.md) records the measured numbers, which came in a fifth under this on 2026-09-19.

### 5.8 Trust

The host is the truth; a client is a view and a source of requests. What a client can do is send orders, and the host validates every one (§4.7); what it can know is its interest set (§5.2), so there is nothing to extract from a client's memory that the host did not choose to send. The content hash at join covers everything the host loaded, mods included (§8), and a client whose content differs is refused rather than allowed to disagree a minute in.

## 6. The renderer

### 6.1 Shape

Direct3D 12 through the SDK headers and `d3dx12.h`, the one file outside the SDK that R14 admits (owner, 2026-09-17), vendored under `Client/` with its MIT notice and pinned in ADR-004: device, command queue, one command allocator per frame in flight, a flip-model swap chain of three back buffers, descriptor heaps managed by hand, barriers and heap and pipeline descriptions through the helper's structures, three frames in flight with a fence per frame. **A WARP device is a launch option** — `OutpostCommander --capture <landscape> <ticks> <directory>` replays a scripted match headless on the software rasteriser and writes a BMP of the scene target every hundred ticks (the argument is the landscape because M1 has no lobby to choose anything else with, `ADR-004`) — because CI is the agent's compiler and its eyes (§10). A capture is a screenshot the agent reads back, not a texture, which is why it is BMP where every texture is DDS (§8). The scene target at the authored resolution (R12) and the present pass that scales it, with the 1:1, integer and bilinear cases `AGENTS.md` §5 lists.

**ADR-004, the first client ADR,** settles the authored resolution, the window style and whether the scene target is multisampled (2026-09-17), as this design assumed: 1920×1080, a borderless window covering the primary monitor with Escape and Alt+F4 owned by the game, and a 4× multisampled scene target — flat-shaded geometry with hard silhouettes is exactly the content that aliases worst and that multisampling fixes best, and the back buffer cannot be multisampled, which is the reason the scene target exists.

### 6.2 Passes

| Pass | Draws | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| Terrain | Chunked landscape meshes, 32×32 cells per chunk with four levels of detail by sample stride and skirts, vertex colour from the palette, two directional lights, per-face normals | One PSO; chunks culled by frustum; the near band at full detail, the rest at a stride that keeps the visible count near a million triangles |
| Water | One plane at the water level with the wave texture scrolling, and the shore band | One PSO, alpha blended |
| Geometry | Every device, structure, feature and wreck: models, per-vertex colour, team colour substituted, instanced per model | One PSO; one instance buffer per model per frame |
| Debris | The triangles of a destroyed model, tumbling and fading (`SpeciesLook.md` §8): the Geometry pass's vertex data drawn with one transform per **triangle** rather than one per model | One PSO, alpha blended; the Geometry pixel shader with an alpha, its own vertex shader; a bounded pool of live triangles, the oldest explosion dropped when it is full |
| Sprites | Billboards for infantry-sized things, the population, and particles | **Two** pipeline states over one vertex and pixel shader, instanced: alpha tested for the cutout billboards, whose alpha is binary because the population is a colour-keyed sprite; and additive (`ONE, ONE`) for particles and effect sprites, whose alpha is a luminance falloff that an alpha test would turn into a hard disc and that `SRC_ALPHA, ONE` would apply twice (`SpeciesLineage.md` §4, measured 2026-09-19) |
| Fog | A full-screen composite darkening explored-not-visible cells and blacking unexplored ones, from the commander's visibility as the replica knows it. The pixel's cell comes from the depth buffer through the inverse view projection, so what is darkened is whatever was drawn there; the darkening is the blend state (`ZERO`, `SRC_COLOR`), so the colour target is never read while it is a render target; the grid is fetched per cell with no sampler, because interpolating between two fog states would invent a third | One PSO |
| UI | Windows, text, icons, the minimap | One PSO, orthographic, alpha blended |
| Present | The scene target into the back buffer, scaled | One PSO |

Seven pixel shaders and about as many vertex shaders, hand-written HLSL under `NeuronClient/Shaders/`, compiled by `FXCompile` into `NeuronClient/CompiledShaders/` (`AGENTS.md` §2). Shader model 6 through the SDK's `dxc`, which `FXCompile` drives on the pinned toolset when the model is 6.x (ADR-004, 2026-09-17).

**The terrain mesh is the one place the numbers bite.** A Large landscape at four samples per cell edge is 2,049 × 2,049 samples: 8.4 million triangles and 67 MB of vertices at full resolution, which is not drawn whole. Chunks are 32 × 32 cells — 129 × 129 samples, 16,641 vertices, inside 16-bit indices — with four levels of detail by sample stride (1, 2, 4, 8) and a skirt on each chunk to hide the cracks between levels; a Large landscape is 256 chunks, of which the ones in the near band draw at full detail and the rest at a stride that keeps the visible count near a million triangles. The fog of `SpeciesLook.md` §5 either scales with the landscape or becomes distance desaturation (owner, 2026-09-17), and which of the two decides how much of the far field is drawn at all: ADR-005 picked the desaturation on two captured frames (2026-09-17), so the whole frustum is drawn and the budget bounds it, the far plane scales with the landscape, and the depth is reversed for the precision the far field then needs; the owner confirms or overrides the fog at `m0-foundation/T22`.

**The budget is not what holds as landscapes grow** (ADR-007, 2026-09-18). It bounds triangles, and triangles are not the binding constraint: every chunk of a Frontier landscape at the coarsest stride is 655,360 triangles against a budget of a million, so the budget never engages there. What does not survive is that every chunk is built at all four strides at construction and held for the match — 636 kB a chunk, so 651 MB resident and some 24 seconds of mesh building on Frontier, neither of which the budget can see. Residency is therefore bounded instead of the view: the coarsest level, 1.7% of a chunk, stays resident for the whole landscape so any chunk can always be drawn, and strides 1, 2 and 4 are built only within a radius of the camera and released beyond it. Resident terrain becomes 10.2 to 59.9 MB across the four size classes, nothing is culled by distance, and the player sees no change. The next wall is draw calls — 1,024 chunks on Frontier before the frustum takes its share — which `m4-frontier/T1` measures. The renderer's distances are **not** line of sight: the Fog pass above reads the commander's visibility as the replica knows it, integer and deterministic under `AGENTS.md` R16, and no render distance may ever feed it.

### 6.3 The render view

The executable builds, each frame, a plain list of what to draw from the replica: for each object a model id, a position and an orientation interpolated between the last two frames (the first float conversion of a simulation number, and the only place it happens, and it is to **world units**), a team colour and a rank badge; for the terrain, which chunks changed height since the last frame; and the commander's fog grid with the rows of it that changed, which the fog pass copies and the minimap draws, so that the two can never disagree. `Client` draws the list. `Client` never sees a `Device`. The render-view and height-view types are plain aggregates in `NeuronCore`, in the engine namespace, so that `Replica` produces them and `Client` consumes them without an edge between the two (`ImplementationPlan.md` §6; ADR-001 records it).

**A shot is an instance like any other, and the builder remembers it** (`m1-vertical-slice/C8`). A `Shot` event says who fired, what was aimed at and the tick the trigger was pulled; the weapon's row says what its shot looks like and for how long (`projectileModel`, `projectileLifetimeTicks`). The builder takes the muzzle from the shooter's own composition — the firing module's `MarkerMuzzle` carried through the module's transform and then the device's, while the device is composed rather than by composing it twice — and draws an instance of `RenderInstanceKind::Projectile` along the line from there to the point aimed at, from the event's own tick so that it is neither a frame early nor a frame late. **It has to remember it**, because an event is replaced by every applied frame and a shot outlives one; it keeps shots exactly as it keeps what it has flattened. **And it takes a frame's events once**, keyed on the replica's newest sequence: a client draws many frames inside one publish interval and the events are not emptied between them, so a builder that read them every build put a second shot in the air for every drawn frame. A shot whose shooter this commander cannot see is not drawn, which is §5.2 holding without a second mechanism: the host never sends him the event, and there would be no muzzle for it to leave from if it did.

### 6.4 The look, mechanically

The values are in the three reference documents: [`SpeciesLook.md`](SpeciesLook.md) for lights, materials, fog, sky, camera, particles and the pixel effect; [`SpeciesTerrain.md`](SpeciesTerrain.md) for the generator, the palette lookup, the overlay and the water; [`SpeciesCanvas.md`](SpeciesCanvas.md) for the window toolkit's rules, the chrome palette and the fonts. This section says how each becomes a pass.

- **Models** are new (owner, 2026-09-17) and are JSON files under `GameData\Models` (§8) holding what the Species `.shp` record holds: positions, one colour per vertex, triangles, named markers, a fragment tree. Loaded once into vertex and index buffers by `NeuronClient/ModelBuffers.cpp`: positions as `float` in world units, one colour per vertex, and **one normal per triangle baked by the loader**, which is what ADR-011 decided of the two the first draft of this line left open. The vertex is split on *(the description's vertex, the triangle's colour, the triangle's direction)* — the colour alone already forces most of that split, because a flat attribute comes from the triangle's first vertex — and the outward normal is `cross(c − a, b − a)`, the handedness the SDK's front-face rule implies. The derivative form the terrain uses stays in `TerrainPS.hlsl` and is not a second path for models. Markers — attachment points for turrets, muzzles and build effects — come across as they are.
- **Lighting** is the Species model: Lambert only, no ambient, two directional lights whose colours may exceed 1.0, summed and clamped after the sum, one normal and one colour per triangle — with the one exception pillar 3 demands (owner, 2026-09-17): a vertex flagged as a team-colour slot is written unlit, so no sun tints a commander's colour. A shader of a dozen lines and one flag bit.
- **Terrain colour** is the Species formula, computed on the CPU when a chunk is built: `u = (1 − slope)^0.4`, `v = 1 − height / highest`, plus noise, indexed into a 64×64 palette. Floats, because it never reaches the simulation.
- **Text** is a bitmap font atlas drawn as quads at 1:1 at the authored resolution: the Species Spectrum font (owner, 2026-09-17), loaded from `GameData\Textures`, in the 16-by-14-cell atlas format `SpeciesCanvas.md` §4 describes.
- **The UI toolkit** is a window-and-widget system in the Eclipse shape, with the rules `SpeciesCanvas.md` §2 writes down and the chrome its §3 tabulates: windows own widgets, the input router offers events to the topmost window first, a widget that acts on an event consumes it, and nothing in it polls.

### 6.5 Input and audio

**Input** takes the Species `input-native-events` design as its specification, because it is the best-documented piece of engineering in that tree and every rule in it was learned the hard way: one message pump per frame; the window procedure enqueues events and does nothing else; a pure per-frame derivation with one edge per control per frame; Raw Input for camera aim with `WM_MOUSEMOVE` as the fallback, guarded on *a relative packet actually arrived*; text as `WM_CHAR` characters to the focused widget; a router that offers events UI-first and masks a consumed key until release; subscriptions that are move-only handles. And the rule that matters most here: **the simulation never subscribes to input.** Input becomes orders through `Net`, nowhere else.

**Audio** is XAudio2 with X3DAudio positioning, ported from the Species `SoundLibraryXAudio2` backend, with the Species `Sounds.txt` event model — an event per (object kind, event) naming a sample group, a position type, a loop type and parameter curves for volume and pitch — carried across as `GameData\Sounds.json`, and the samples as WAV files under `GameData\Sounds`. Device loss is handled as Species does: park silent, rebuild every few seconds until a device comes back.

## 7. AI

In `Sim`, on the host, deterministic, one planner and a table of personalities (`GameDesign.md` §9). Structurally: an AI seat observes the simulation through the same visibility grid as a human and holds a small blackboard — known enemy structures, a threat map at cluster resolution, its own economy and army composition; each tick, within its budget, it evaluates a fixed list of behaviours (expand, defend, research, build army, attack) with personality weights and emits orders for tick *t + delay* through the same queue as a client. No threads, no wall time, no floats. The highest difficulty takes a power bonus and never vision (owner, 2026-09-17). The scripted opponent of the vertical slice is the same structure with one behaviour list hard-coded.


**What the vertical slice built** (`m1-vertical-slice/S12`, 2026-09-19): `GameLogic/AiBlackboard` is the observation, `GameLogic/AiDesigner` the scoring `GameDesign.md` §9 describes — every unlocked chassis, drive and module scored as expected damage per power against the composition it has actually seen, through the damage matrix — and `GameLogic/AiSeat` the one hard-coded behaviour list M2 replaces with personality weights. Everything in the blackboard is derived and rebuilt every decision, so **the AI adds nothing to the state hash and nothing to the snapshot**: a blackboard that were state would be a second copy of the world two hosts could disagree about. A seat decides every ten ticks, staggered by seat index so eight commanders never decide on one tick, and submits through the ordinary queue for tick *t* + 2.

Three orderings inside that list are not arbitrary and cost a run each to find. **A generator goes up before the second extractor**, because `GameDesign.md` §4 says an extractor earns nothing until one reaches it, and a commander that claimed four deposits first spent four extractors' worth of power on an income of nothing. **Nothing new is placed while there are more unfinished sites than builders to work them**, with a slack of one: without the rule a single truck is spread over six plans and finishes none, and without the slack a site no builder can reach — a deposit on a summit no drive can climb — stops the commander building anything else for the rest of the match. And **the attack behaviour is evaluated on every decision rather than taking its turn in the list**, because idle fighters are not a resource the base is competing for: behind the queue it never ran at all, since a factory with something to produce answers first every decision. A group is sent to the start position furthest from its own base when it has seen nothing yet — the landscape's definition is public to every commander (§5.2), so that is what a human knows too — and four cells short of it, because the cell a commander starts on is where his command post stands and a structure's cells are impassable.

**THE SLACK OF ONE DID NOT WORK UNTIL 2026-09-19, and what it took to make it work is worth the paragraph.** The sentence above was what the code intended and what `GameLogic/AiSeat.cpp` claimed in a comment, and both were wrong: the behaviour that walks a builder to an unfinished site answered *before* the slack was ever consulted, and it answered `true` for as long as there was a site and an idle builder — including a site no builder could be got to. A commander with one unreachable site therefore never reached the generator, the factory or the lab at all, and the slack written for exactly that case could never be used. It took a perturbation to see, because the tree's own seed happened not to produce one; raising the viewer's eye by 16 world units produced one on every seed tried, which is how it was found.

`m1-vertical-slice/S13` fixed it, and the shape of the fix is the part that generalises. **A behaviour that issues a `Move` and answers `true` starves everything below it whenever the `Move` cannot succeed**, so the guard belongs in one function that every such behaviour calls rather than inside the one where the symptom showed — `Finish` and `Scout` both walk a builder somewhere and both had it. That function sends a device to a cell *beside* a footprint and never onto it (a structure occupies its cells from the tick construction begins, so the planner refuses a route to one), it tests only that the cell is *in* the cluster graph and never that it shares a component with the device (a component is local to a 16-by-16 cluster, so two cells a truck can drive between are routinely in different ones), and it declines to re-send a device to a destination it is already standing still having failed to reach — which is the only memory a decision has, and it is the device's own, because `GameLogic/Movement.cpp` leaves the destination in place when it gives a route up.

**A SCRIPTED SEAT MUST BE SEATED WITH AUTO-RESEARCH ON, and until 2026-09-20 the game did not do it** (`m1-vertical-slice/S15`). The behaviour list above has no research behaviour, deliberately: `S6` gives every idle lab an auto-research flag on the seat, and `GameLogic/AiSeat.h` says in as many words that a scripted seat is set up with it. `OutpostCommander/App.cpp`'s lobby did not set it, so the commander the game actually ships was locked out of the entire research table for the whole match — and therefore out of every weapon except the machine gun, which is the only one unlocked from the first tick.

**That made the game unwinnable by the AI, and the arithmetic is worth writing down because it is not obvious from the tables.** A machine gun does 8 damage of the anti-light class. Against a command post — strength `Hard`, the eighth column — the matrix scales it by 30% to 2; the post's 20 kinetic armour is met in full, because the anti-light class counts 100% of armour; and `GameShared/DamageTable.h`'s floor of "never under a third of the scaled damage" is a third of 2, which is **nought in whole points**. So a machine gun deals *exactly zero* to a command post, for ever, however many of them there are. Measured on the slice landscape at seed 1: fifty simulated minutes, the enemy army swept from the field, 153 machine guns standing around an enemy command post at full health, and a match that could not end. With the flag set the same match is decided in 12,874 ticks, and six of seven seeds sampled decide between 11,673 and 34,264 ticks.

**Nothing caught it, and the reason is the lesson.** Every unit suite passed throughout, because `Tests/GameLogicTests/AiTests.cpp`'s fixture sets the flag — the suites tested a commander that researches while the executable ran one that does not. The gap was between a library's documented contract and the one caller that had to honour it, which is a seam no unit test of either side can see. The capture now reports how many items the watched commander has researched and CI refuses a run where that is zero, because the capture is the only thing in the tree that plays the lobby the game ships.

**And the seventh seed still does not finish, which is a second and separate defect** (`m1-vertical-slice/S16`, open). With research working the commander fields cannons, which destroy buildings perfectly well, and on seed 7 it still cannot finish: measured at 80,000 ticks, 78 cannons holding the enemy base as their target with **not one of them firing**. A device that chases a target sets its destination to the target's own position (`GameLogic/Targeting.cpp`), and a structure's cells are impassable — so the planner answers Unreachable, `Movement` stands the device down to `Stop`, and the closing rule gives it the order again on the next tick, for ever. It is not the scripted commander's defect: a human's own Attack-move on a building walks into the same wall. The fix is a stand-off point on standable ground within weapon range, which is what `S13` already had to build for the AI's attack groups (`StandableNear`), and it needs care about the planner's shared 2,000-node budget when eighty devices ask at once — two variants tried on 2026-09-20 each fixed some seeds and cost others, which is why it is a task and not a line.

**And a third rule came out of the same measurement: a scripted commander must cancel a plan it can no longer build.** A plan does not occupy its cells (`GameShared/Plan.h`), so two may overlap and the first to begin construction leaves the other refused for ever; §4.5 is explicit that such a plan "stays a plan until it is cancelled", which is right for a human who can see it. The blackboard counts what a seat holds *built or building*, so an uncancelled dead plan counts as the thing it was going to be and the behaviour that would place another never runs. The commander now asks the same question stage 5 asks before it begins a site, and cancels what stage 5 would refuse.

## 8. Content

**Game data is files** (owner, 2026-09-17: R13 withdrawn), **in JSON** (owner, 2026-09-17), under a `GameData\` directory beside the executable, resolved from the executable's own path and never from the working directory. It was `Content\` until 2026-09-18, when the owner separated it from the `GameShared` project: that library is the loaders, this tree is what they load, and one name for both had put textures and tables inside a source directory. In the repository it is `GameData/` at the root. **Getting it beside the executable is the owner's step** (owner, 2026-09-18), not a build target: nothing in the projects copies it, and a run that does not find it says so and falls back where it can — the terrain to its built-in gradient, the loaders to a refusal. R14 still holds, so the JSON reader is written into `NeuronCore`: a strict parser of the standard grammar, about three hundred lines, with the file, line and column in every error. The layout:

```
GameData\
  Components.json          chassis, drives and modules (GameDesign.md §6), with the derivation formulas
  Research.json            the research tree (GameDesign.md §7)
  Structures.json          the structure catalogue and modules (GameDesign.md §5)
  Damage.json              the weapon-class by target-class modifier matrix (GameDesign.md §8)
  Sounds.json              the sound-event table, the Species Sounds.txt model
  Biomes.json              per biome: palette, water and wave textures, the light pair, fog, sky (SpeciesLook.md, SpeciesTerrain.md)
  Landscapes\*.json        a landscape definition: size class, seed, tiles, stamp placement (SpeciesTerrain.md §2 in JSON)
  Stamps\*.json            authored terrain patches
  Models\*.json            positions, colours, triangles, markers, fragments
  Terrain\*.dds            the landscape palettes, the water and the wave textures (DDS, below)
  Textures\*.dds           sprites, icons, the font (DDS, below)
  Sounds\*.wav             16-bit PCM, which XAudio2 plays as it is
Mods\<name>\...            the same tree; a file here overrides the one at the same path under Content\
```

**The terrain's own textures sit under `Terrain\`** (owner, 2026-09-18), apart from the sprites, icons and font of `Textures\`: a palette, a water pattern and a wave belong to the landscape, two of them read on the processor rather than only uploaded, and Species drew the same line in its own tree (`SpeciesLineage.md` §2). A biome names its three under `Terrain\` and the validator looks for them there.

**Mods** are M3 work and are directories under `Mods\` in the user's directory ([`ADR-016`](ADR/ADR-016-package-identity-and-launch.md): the install directory is inside the package and unwritable), enabled by name in the **server's configuration** ([`ADR-020`](ADR/ADR-020-central-server-no-lobby-no-pause.md)); the loader reads `GameData\` and then each enabled mod in order, and a file in a mod replaces the file at the same path. Nothing else is needed for a mod that changes numbers, adds a component or a model, or replaces a sound.

**Validation happens at load and in CI with one implementation.** At load, `GameShared` checks that every research prerequisite names an existing item and the tree has no cycle; that every component's unlock names an item; that every model, texture and sound a table names exists; that no id is duplicated; that every number is in its range — and refuses to start on a failure, naming the file and line. In CI, `OutpostHost --validate` loads `GameData\` with that same code and exits non-zero on any failure, so a table edit that would break the game breaks the build first, without a second implementation of the rules to keep in step.

**The content hash**, also M3, is a 64-bit digest over the bytes of every file loaded, in load order, mods included, computed at start and sent at join (§5.4). Two players with different files are refused each other's matches before the first tick.

**Textures are DDS** (owner, 2026-09-17), and only DDS: the DirectDraw Surface container, whose header names a `DXGI_FORMAT` and whose payload is the texture as the GPU takes it, so that one reader in `NeuronCore` serves every pass and an upload is a copy, never a conversion. The reader parses the header and its DX10 extension, computes the mip chain from the format's block size, refuses cube maps and texture arrays until a pass needs them, hands block-compressed data straight to the upload path, and decodes only uncompressed formats for the two consumers that read texels on the CPU — the terrain palette lookup (§6.4) and the font metrics. **The default is uncompressed `B8G8R8A8_UNORM` with no mip chain**, because the palettes are colour ramps a lookup reads exactly, and the sprites, icons and font are pixel art drawn 1:1 (pillar 3): block compression would put its error into exactly the pixels that matter. Compression (`BC1`, `BC3`, `BC7`) and mips are permitted per texture where one is ever large enough for them to matter, applied by the importer and passed through by the loader. The content ADR records the admitted formats.

**Importers**, under `Tools/`, never ship: `ImportShp.py` converts a Species `.shp` into a model JSON, keeping fragments, colours, triangles from both encodings and markers (the review tool that rendered the Species set is its prototype); `ImportSounds.py` selects and copies WAVs by the names `Sounds.txt` references; `ImportTextures.py` converts the Species BMPs to DDS, expanding the 8-bit ones through their palette and turning a sprite's colour key into alpha, and writes uncompressed DDS itself — a header and the pixels — so that the only tool a compressed texture would need, the SDK's `texconv`, is an option nobody has taken yet.

**Models compose at markers.** A chassis model carries `MarkerMount*` and `MarkerDrive*` markers; a drive model is drawn at the chassis's drive markers — a wheel per marker, a track per side — and a module model at a mount marker, with its own `MarkerMuzzle` for the shot. A device is therefore three models drawn as a tree, not one model per combination, and the model count is chassis + drives + modules rather than their product. Authoring is any tool that exports Wavefront OBJ: `ImportObj.py` takes positions, faces and per-face material colours into a model JSON, and an object named `Marker*` becomes a marker at its origin with its orientation.

**Shaders are the one thing still compiled in**: HLSL under `NeuronClient/Shaders/`, compiled at build time by `FXCompile` (`AGENTS.md` §2), never loaded at runtime.

## 9. What the executable reads and writes

Decided (owner, 2026-09-17):

| Where | What | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `<executable directory>\Content\` | the game's data (§8) | read; the install may be read-only |
| `<executable directory>\Mods\` | mods (§8) | read |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OutpostCommander\` | everything the game writes, created on first use | read and write |

Under the user directory:

| File | Written by | Form |
|---|---|---|
| `Preferences.json` | client | scaling mode, key bindings, audio volumes, player name; absent means defaults |
| `Designs.json` | client | the commander's saved device designs (`GameDesign.md` §6) |
| `Saves\*.fcsave` | host | a snapshot (§4.9) plus settings, versioned |
| `Replays\*.fcreplay` | host | settings, seed, order stream, versioned; always recorded, the oldest pruned |
| `Logs\Host.log` | host | what the host did and why a client was refused; rotated |
| `Logs\Client.log` | client | what the client did: the adapter, the scene target, every debug-layer message; rotated (ADR-004) |

The headless host, run as a service or by another user, uses the same layout under its own profile. Nothing resolves against the working directory. The preferences ADR records the preferences schema and ADR-003 the save and replay formats.

## 10. Testing

- **`Sim` is the bulk of the suite, and determinism is its first test.** Two matches from one seed and one order stream hash identically at every tick; a snapshot taken at tick *n* and reloaded continues to the same hashes as the original; a replay reproduces a recorded match hash for hash. These three tests exist from M0, and every later feature runs under them.
- **The protocol is tested over `LoopbackTransport`**, in `Tests/IntegrationTests` — the one suite allowed both endpoints ([`ADR-018`](ADR/ADR-018-client-server-libraries.md)) — as Species does: join, a full frame, deltas against an acked baseline, a lost frame recovered by the next delta, a full frame after the history is exhausted, orders delivered reliably through loss, a slow client dropped to AI — the conversation, not the encodings.
- **Interest is a security property and is tested as one**: for every publish in a scripted match, no record in a client's frame — object, design, ghost or flatten delta — names anything outside its commander's visibility, own objects and ghost store. This is the test that makes the fog of war real.
- **`Replica` converges**: applying a host's frames, with and without loss, produces a replica equal to the host's interest set at every acked frame, and interpolation never places an object outside the segment between two frames.
- **`GameShared`** loads the shipped tree, refuses each of a set of deliberately broken files with the right file and line, and applies a mod overlay; `OutpostHost --validate` is the same code and agrees by construction.
- **`NeuronCore`** tests the JSON reader against a conformance set (including the pathological documents), the DDS and WAV readers against small fixtures built by hand in the tests, and its arithmetic exhaustively where the domain is small (the binary-angle tables, the integer square root, the fixed-point multiply).
- **`Client` and the executables** are tested by running them (`AGENTS.md` §3); the pure parts — the input derivation, the UI router — get unit tests, as the Species input work showed they can.
- **The renderer is tested by capture, because CI is the agent's compiler and its eyes.** Claude Code sessions for this project run on Linux and cannot build (owner, 2026-09-17), so every push builds and tests `Debug|x64` on the Windows runner (`AGENTS.md` §6), and a capture job runs `OutpostCommander --capture` (§6.1) on WARP over a scripted match and uploads the BMPs as artefacts the agent reads back; a Direct3D 12 debug-layer message during the capture fails the job. A Linux build of the portable libraries was considered and rejected: it would be a second build system, which `AGENTS.md` §3 forbids, and the test framework is Windows-only.

A `SuiteSmoke` placeholder in every test project until its first real test, as `AGENTS.md` §3 requires, because vstest reports an empty suite as a pass. Tests never open a socket, a window or an audio device, and never read `Content\` in place — a test that needs files writes its own under a temporary directory — the Species `docs/TESTING.md` rules, which are the right rules.

## 11. Risks

| Risk | Why it is real | What the design does about it |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | This is a strategy game with a design system, a research tree, an AI, replicated multiplayer and a large-map renderer, with no library for any of it, by one developer | Milestones that are playable states, a vertical slice that cuts everything not on the critical path, and data files so that content is not code |
| **Replication** | A second world model that must stay a faithful reading of the host's; interest management that is also the fog-of-war security; bandwidth peaks in large battles; a view that is always 100–200 ms behind | `Replica` as a tested library, the interest test of §10, the arithmetic of §5.7 measured in ADR-012, no prediction to get wrong, and loopback from M1 so that it is exercised from the first playable build (owner, 2026-09-17) |
| **Large landscapes** | Pathing, visibility and terrain rendering scale with the map; a Frontier landscape is sixteen times a *Warzone* map | Hierarchical pathing, budgeted visibility, chunked terrain — and M4, not M1, is where Frontier-class maps must perform |
| **Hand-written readers** | JSON, DDS and WAV readers under R14 are small and are exactly where a malformed file becomes a crash | Strict parsers with fixtures and conformance tests; content refused at load with a location, never partially loaded |
| **D3D12 with one helper** | R14 admits `d3dx12.h` and nothing else (owner, 2026-09-17), so its structures describe barriers, heaps and root signatures, and everything above them — descriptor management, uploads, the frame loop, the pipelines — is hand-written | Seven fixed pipelines, no material system, no generality: write the little the game needs, once; the header is a pinned file in the tree with its licence beside it, never fetched |
| **Provenance of the Species content** | The effects, palettes, sprites, icons and the Darwinia-derived code have no established licence, and the owner has chosen to use them and carry the risk, including handing them to other players in M3 and inside mods (2026-09-17) | The provenance ADR records the decision and the list; the soundtrack, the branding and the narration are excluded regardless |
| **Text at scale** | A pixel font resampled is the cost of the scaled present | 1:1 at the authored resolution is the common path; the ADR settles the resolution with that in mind |

---

## 12. The first decisions, as ADRs

The ADRs the first tasks will write, in the order the work meets them. Where the owner has already decided, the ADR records the decision and adds the measurement. An ADR takes the next free number when it is written, and this table is updated in that commit (`ImplementationPlan.md` §6); a row without a number is one not yet written, and the documents name it by its subject. The tasks that write them are in `tasks/`.

| ADR | Decision | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| 001 | The solution and project layout of §2, the eight projects and their edges, the two namespaces | The first project (written 2026-09-17) |
| 002 | The 20 Hz tick; the position unit and the fixed-point formats of §4.1; the hash's order and the order record; the empty tick measured, and a dated section for the full tick when the slice has one | The first `Sim` task (`m0-foundation/T15`, written 2026-09-17); the full-tick measurements by `m1-vertical-slice/G3` |
| 003 | The snapshot and replay formats | The first snapshot (`m0-foundation/T15`, written 2026-09-17), because the determinism tests need the format from M0; the save file of M2 and the replay file of M3 cite it |
| 004 | The renderer: authored resolution, window style, scene target multisampling; the `d3dx12.h` exception and its pinned version; which shader compiler `FXCompile` drives on the pinned toolset | The first renderer task (`m0-foundation/T18`, written 2026-09-17) |
| 005 | The fog's form and the unlit team-colour slots, ruled on captured frames: distance desaturation, the slots neither lit nor fogged, the far plane scaling with the landscape and the reversed depth that follow | The terrain pass (`m0-foundation/T20`, written 2026-09-17); the owner confirms or overrides the fog at `m0-foundation/T22` |
| 007 | The view budget: the fog range absolute in world units with a ceiling on the desaturation, superseding 005's fractions on the owner's frame; terrain chunk residency bounded by radius with the coarsest level resident everywhere, which holds for the four shipping size classes and is stated as O(area) that a quadtree must replace beyond them; the renderer's distances explicitly not line of sight | The owner's frame of 2026-09-18 (written 2026-09-18); the residency it specifies is built by `m3-multiplayer/T11` and measured by `m4-frontier/T1` |
| 008 | The fog grid, the first O(area) state a snapshot carries, run-length encoded; ADR-003's refusal of compression superseded for that one section on the measurement it demanded | The seat's fog grid (`m1-vertical-slice/S1`, written 2026-09-18); `S9`, which fills the grids, revisits the size on its own measurements |
| 009 | The simulation reads the content tree, taken by reference and never written; a snapshot carries the digest of the tables it was written against and refuses any other | The first system that reads rows (`m1-vertical-slice/C5`, written 2026-09-18), answering `OpenQuestions.md` Q20 |
| 011 | Model normals baked by the loader on a split vertex rather than taken from the pixel shader's derivatives, settling the choice §6.4 left open; the outward normal's handedness, and the winding diagnostic that checks it | The geometry pass (`m1-vertical-slice/K1`, written 2026-09-18); the captured frame its acceptance asks for is owed once `G2` lands |
| 012 | The network model — host-authoritative replication, as decided — and the measured protocol numbers: publish rate, history length, quantisation, fragment size, the interest set as a security boundary, and the leak posture of §5.2 | The host endpoint (`m1-vertical-slice/N2`, written 2026-09-19); the bytes a frame takes at 100 and 600 visible objects are measured in it |
| 006 | The content directory, the JSON schemas and their versioning, the ranges and units of every field, the loading and validation rules, and `OutpostHost --validate` | The first loader (`m1-vertical-slice/C1`, written 2026-09-17); the DDS formats a texture may use, the overlay rule for mods and the content hash join it as they are built (`C4`, M3) |
| 010 | The Species-derived content that came across and the accepted provenance risk, stated to cover distribution to other players and inside mods; the Spectrum font | The first importer run (`m1-vertical-slice/C4`, written 2026-09-18) |
| — | The user directory and the preferences schema | The first task that needs a setting to persist, numbered when written |
| — | The debris pool: how many live triangles the Debris pass of §6.2 holds and in what order it evicts, ruled on a frame of several commanders losing an army at once rather than on one death | `m2-skirmish/T12`, numbered when written |
