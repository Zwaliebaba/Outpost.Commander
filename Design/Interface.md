# Interface — what the operator sees and clicks in M1

The M1 interface, as fixed panels at the authored resolution. It exists because the vertical slice cannot run without a specification of the screen: `m1-vertical-slice/K3` builds the toolkit from it, `K4` builds these panels from it, `G1` wires the orders, and neither is meant to invent anything. `Design/README.md` said this document is written before M1 starts; this is it.

**Status: DESIGN.** Written by `m1-vertical-slice/D1` on 2026-09-17. The owner's merge of its pull request is its acceptance, and §12 lists the rulings it takes that a reader may want to overturn before merging.

**M2 restyles this, it does not replace it.** The Eclipse-shaped windows of `SpeciesCanvas.md` are M2's, and they carry the same content in movable windows. Everything here is written so that a panel's *content* survives that change and only its frame is redrawn.

---

## 1. The rules this document works under

- **Everything is authored at 1920×1080 and unconditional** (ADR-004). Every rectangle, margin and glyph in this document is in authored pixels. Exactly one place reads the window's size, `FitAuthored`, and the present pass scales the finished frame.
- **Flat rectangles, one-pixel borders, a pixel font, monochrome icons with one accent colour** (`GameDesign.md` §11.4). No gradient fills except the two the chrome palette names, no drop shadows on panels, no animation except the two this document allows.
- **Readable at a glance outranks the Species look** (`GameDesign.md` pillar 3). Where `SpeciesCanvas.md` and pillar 3 disagree, pillar 3 wins, and §12 records each time it did.
- **The interface reads the replica and emits orders. It never reads the simulation.** Every panel below names what it reads from the render view or the replica and what orders it emits. A panel that needs a number nobody replicates is a defect in this document or in `N1`, not something a panel computes from the simulation.
- **The interface is the router's first sink** (`NeuronClient/InputRouter.h`). A widget that acts on an event consumes it; a panel under the cursor consumes clicks so they never reach selection.

**The world view is the whole frame.** The scene is drawn at 1920×1080 and the panels are drawn over it, so the camera never has a smaller viewport than the screen and a unit is never hidden behind a panel without the player being able to scroll to it. The consequence is that the bottom 288 rows and the two 40-row corners are obscured; picking refuses a ray whose origin is inside a panel rectangle (§5), so nothing is ever selected through a panel.

**Nothing moves.** No panel slides, collapses, or animates its size. The two animations this document allows are the tooltip's typewriter (§4) and the construction and research progress bars, which advance with their value and nothing else.

---

## 3. The chrome

One palette table, `GameData\Interface.json`, loaded by `Content` alongside the other tables, so that the look of a panel is data (`SpeciesCanvas.md` §7). Every colour below is that file's starting value, in 8-bit RGBA. The same file carries the eight commander colours of `GameDesign.md` §11, which are not chrome but are read by the same panels and the same minimap, and one file of eight rows is cheaper than a second loader (`C6`).

| Role | Colour | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `panelFill` | (24, 10, 12, 245) | Every panel's body |
| `panelBorder` | (199, 214, 220, 255) | The one-pixel border of every panel |
| `panelTitleFrom` | (199, 214, 220, 255) | The title strip's gradient, top |
| `panelTitleTo` | (112, 141, 168, 255) | The title strip's gradient, bottom |
| `titleText` | (255, 255, 150, 255) | A panel's title, uppercased |
| `bodyText` | (222, 226, 230, 255) | Labels and values |
| `dimText` | (128, 132, 136, 255) | A value that is unavailable or zero |
| `accent` | (255, 196, 64, 255) | The one accent: selection, the active tab, a ready item |
| `warning` | (232, 96, 72, 255) | A rejection, a losing state, damage under a quarter |
| `buttonFill` | (107, 37, 39, 255) | A button at rest |
| `buttonFillHover` | (140, 52, 54, 255) | Under the cursor |
| `buttonFillDown` | (199, 214, 220, 255) | Held |
| `buttonDisabled` | (60, 32, 34, 255) | Unavailable; its caption takes `dimText` |
| `barEmpty` | (40, 20, 22, 255) | A progress or health bar's track |
| `barBuild` | (120, 180, 220, 255) | Construction and production progress |
| `barHealth` | (96, 200, 108, 255) | Health at or over half |
| `barHealthLow` | (232, 96, 72, 255) | Health under a quarter |

**A panel** is a filled rectangle in `panelFill`, a one-pixel `panelBorder` on all four edges, and a 20-pixel title strip along the top filled with the vertical gradient `panelTitleFrom` → `panelTitleTo`, holding the panel's name in `titleText`, uppercased, at x + 8. The client area is inset 8 pixels left, right and bottom, and starts 24 pixels from the top.

**A button** is a filled rectangle with a one-pixel `panelBorder`, 24 pixels high, its caption in `bodyText` centred vertically and inset 8 pixels from the left, or centred when the button is square. Its fill is `buttonFill`, `buttonFillHover`, `buttonFillDown` or `buttonDisabled`; a down button's caption takes `panelFill` so that it stays readable on the light fill.

**A bar** is a filled `barEmpty` rectangle with a one-pixel `panelBorder`, 12 pixels high, filled from the left in its value's colour. A bar never animates toward its value; it is drawn at the value the frame has.

**An icon** is 32×32 authored pixels from `GameData\Textures\Icons.dds`, drawn as one quad in `bodyText` where it is available and `dimText` where it is not, on the panel fill. Monochrome with one accent (`GameDesign.md` §11.4): an icon is a single-channel mask tinted at draw time, never a coloured bitmap, so that the accent is the palette's and a mod recolours nothing by accident.

### Text

**Text is monospaced, 16 authored pixels a glyph box, with a 16-pixel advance and a 20-pixel line height.** The Spectrum atlas is 16 columns by 14 rows of 16×16 cells from ASCII 32 (`SpeciesCanvas.md` §4), and a glyph drawn at 16×16 is one texel to one pixel. A line of *n* characters is exactly 16*n* pixels wide, which is the arithmetic every layout in this document uses.

This is a ruling against `SpeciesCanvas.md` §7, which asks for sizes 12 and 13 drawn 1:1. At 1920×1080 with a 16-pixel cell, 12 and 13 are not 1:1 with anything: they resample every glyph, which is the single thing pillar 3 and ADR-004's authored resolution exist to prevent. Species drew at 12 and 13 because `GetMenuSize` scaled everything to the window; this game does not scale, so it can afford the atlas's own size. §12 records it as overturnable.

**There is no second size and no second face.** Species's title and caption faces become one; a title is distinguished by its colour and its gradient strip, not by its font.

---

## 4. The pointer, the cursor and input

### Coordinates

`FrameInput::mouseX` and `mouseY` are **client pixels**. Every rectangle in this document is in **authored pixels**. `NeuronClient/ScaleMode.h` maps authored to client through `FitAuthored`; M1 adds its inverse, `AuthoredFromClient(const ScaledRectangle&, clientX, clientY)`, returning the authored position and whether it landed inside the letterbox at all. It is the one place the conversion happens, it lives beside `FitAuthored`, and `K3` writes it with the test that round-trips it against `FitAuthored` at all three scale modes.

A pointer outside the scaled rectangle — in the letterbox bars — is over no panel and over no world, and every hit test refuses it.

### The buttons

**THE POINTER HAS TWO MODES, AND *aim* IS THE DEFAULT** (owner, 2026-09-19; §12 ruling 3, rewritten). In *aim* mode the mouse drives the camera with no button held, Windows' pointer is hidden and warped nowhere, and the thing the commander points at is a ring drawn **on the ground at the centre of the screen** (§4's cursor, below). In *point* mode there is an ordinary pointer and the camera does not turn. **Escape moves between them**, and the pause menu of §10 moves off Escape to **F10** so that one key means one thing.

This is Species's own arrangement (`SpeciesLook.md` §7): in Species the mouse is connected to the camera the whole time a location is being played, and Escape opens a window, which is what releases it. Outpost Commander needs the released mode for more than a menu — §5's drag rectangle, §7's panels and §9's minimap all want a pointer — so the mode is named rather than implied by whether a window happens to be open.

| Input | What it does | Where it is decided |
|---|---|---|
| **Mouse motion, *aim*** | **Turns the camera**, at `AIM_RADIANS_PER_COUNT` a raw count, with no button held | §12, ruling 3 |
| **Mouse motion, *point*** | Moves the pointer; the camera does not turn | §12, ruling 3 |
| **Escape** | **Swaps the mode**: *aim* to *point*, *point* to *aim*; peels an armed order or a modal panel first (§7) | `App` |
| Left click on a panel (*point*) | The widget under it acts and consumes the event | `UiInputSink`, the router's first sink |
| Left click on the world | Selects the object under the ray — the screen's centre in *aim*, the pointer in *point*; nothing under it clears the selection | §5 |
| Left drag on the world (*point* only) | Selects every own device inside the rectangle | §5 |
| **Right click on the world** | **Gives the selection its default order** (§6) | §6 |
| Right click on a panel (*point*) | Nothing; the panel consumes it | `UiInputSink` |
| Wheel | Camera height; over the minimap in *point*, nothing | `CameraController` |
| The arrows, the screen edges (*point* only) | Camera movement, as M0 built them | `CameraController` |
| Page Up, Page Down | Camera height, as M0 built them | `CameraController` |
| Shift | Camera speed ×4; with an order, queues it behind the current one | §6 |

**The right button belongs to the game, and the camera gives it up.** `SpeciesCanvas.md` §2 is explicit that the right button never touches a window, and `G1` needs right-click for Move and Attack. M0's `CameraController` aims with the right button held; M1 takes aiming off the buttons altogether. The alternative considered for M0's problem, a drag threshold that delays every order by up to a quarter second, was refused then and is refused now: an order that arrives late is the one thing a real-time game cannot afford, and `TechnicalDesign.md` §3 already spends 250 to 330 milliseconds getting a click to visible movement.

**The camera flies; it is not held at a height.** `NeuronClient/Camera.h` is already a fly camera — yaw and pitch free, height the commander's, `CAMERA_MIN_CLEARANCE` of 10 above the highest ground within one spacing and `CAMERA_MAX_HEIGHT` of 5,000 — and those are Species's own `MIN_GROUND_CLEARANCE` and `MAX_HEIGHT` to the unit (`SpeciesLook.md` §7). The floor is not a height lock: it pushes the camera up out of the terrain and never pulls it down onto it. Nothing about this changes; it is written here because a reader of the old table could take "camera height" for a fixed one.

### Hotkeys

Bindings live in `Preferences.json` (`TechnicalDesign.md` §9) as a control name to a key, and these are the defaults. `InputSubscription.h` already says the binding layer is M1's.

| Key | Control |
|---|---|
| 1 – 5 | The command panel's tabs: Construct, Produce, Research, Design, Match |
| Ctrl + 0 – 9 | Assign the selection to a numbered group (`Group`) |
| 0 – 9 | Select that group; twice in quick succession centres the camera on it |
| Space | Centre the camera on the selection |
| M, P, R, B | Move, Patrol, Attack-move, Build: arm that order for the next world click |
| S | Stop |
| H | Hold position stance |
| Tab | Cycle the selection through devices of the same design |
| Delete | Demolish the selected own structure, after a confirm click |
| Escape | Cancel an armed order, then a modal panel, then swap the pointer between *aim* and *point* (§4) |
| F10 | The quit menu (§10), from either pointer mode |
| Enter | Open the chat line (§10) |
| F1 | Toggle the panel overlay off, for a clean look at the world |

**Escape is peeled, not swallowed.** It cancels the innermost thing that is open, one press at a time: an armed order first, then a modal panel, and **then it swaps the pointer's mode** (§4). It no longer opens the pause menu — **F10** does, from either mode — because a key that both released the mouse and opened a menu would do one of the two by accident every time. The window procedure owns Escape for closing the window (ADR-004), so `G1` moves that to the pause menu's Quit and the procedure keeps only Alt+F4.

### The cursor

The game draws its own cursor, Windows' being hidden (`SpeciesCanvas.md` §6). There are two of them, and which one is drawn is the pointer's mode.

**In *point* mode: a 32×32 quad** from `Icons.dds` at the pointer, drawn by the UI pass over everything. M1 has six:

| Cursor | When |
|---|---|
| Arrow | The default, over panels and over nothing |
| Select | Over an own device or structure |
| Move | An armed Move or the default order over open ground |
| Attack | Over a visible enemy, or an armed Attack |
| Build | Placing a structure, over legal ground |
| Refuse | Placing over illegal ground, or an order the selection cannot take |

**In *aim* mode: a ring lying on the ground**, at the point where the ray through the centre of the screen meets the landscape — Species's `MouseHighlight` disc (`SpeciesCanvas.md` §6, `SpeciesLook.md` §7.1), which is what the owner asked for on 2026-09-19. It is a world-space quad and not a screen-space one, and **it tilts with the ground**: its up vector is the terrain's interpolated normal, so on a hillside it lies against the hill. The six meanings above still apply — they choose the ring's **tint**, from the same six entries of `Icons.dds`, rather than a different bitmap at the pointer.

The rules it carries over from Species, each with the reason:

| Rule | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Orientation | `up` = the landscape's interpolated normal at the hit; `front` = `normalize(up × worldUp)`, falling back to world `+Z` when that cross product is near zero; `right` = `normalize(front × up)` | The fallback is not decoration: Species's own normal map writes exactly `(0, 1, 0)` for flat ground, `XMVector3Normalize` of a zero vector is zero, and the ring therefore collapses to a point on flat ground in Species today. Outpost Commander's landscape is mostly flat |
| Size | 30 world units × `sqrt(distance to the camera) / 40` | Keeps it roughly the same size on screen without being a billboard: about 15 units across at 400 away, 37 at 2,500 |
| Over water | the hit's height raised to at least 1 world unit | The terrain mesh continues under the sea, so the ray hits the seabed; Species lifts the disc to float on the surface rather than testing the water plane |
| Off the landscape | **hidden**, and the last position is not reused | Species falls back to a sphere thousands of units out and samples a normal off the end of its map, which it gets away with because terrain fills its view. M1 draws a horizon |
| Depth | tested, not written; no culling; biased toward the camera | It is coplanar with the ground it sits on. Species nudges its near plane out 5% for the cursor pass, which is a GL trick with no clean D3D12 equivalent — a slope-scaled depth bias is the one to use |
| Blend | a blurred copy first (`SRC_ALPHA`, `INV_SRC_COLOR`), then the sharp one additively (`SRC_ALPHA`, `ONE`) in the tint | The dark pass is what makes a bright ring readable over bright sand |
| Pulse | `size × (1 + \|sin(4t)\|× 0.6)` while placing a structure | Species animates exactly the placement and move-here cursors, and a placement is the one thing in M1 that wants the eye |

### Tooltips

Hovering a widget for 1,000 milliseconds shows a tooltip: a panel-framed box at the pointer, offset 16 right and 16 down, flipped to the other side when it would leave the frame, holding one or two lines of `bodyText`. The text is revealed at 50 characters a second (`SpeciesCanvas.md` §5), which is the one piece of the overlay's character this document carries. Moving off the widget hides it at once.

---

## 5. Selection

**Where the ray comes from.** In *point* mode it is cast through the pointer, as §4 has always said. In *aim* mode there is no pointer and it is cast through the **centre of the screen**, which is where the ground ring of §4 is drawn: what the commander sees under the ring is what a click takes. Every rule below is about the ray and not about the mouse, so nothing else in this section changes — except the rectangle, which needs two corners and therefore a pointer, and is *point* mode's alone.

**What can be selected.** Own devices and own structures, one at a time by click, or several devices by rectangle. A rectangle never selects structures and never selects another commander's anything. Clicking a visible enemy device or structure selects it as an *inspection*: the selection panel shows it (§8) and the orders panel is empty, because nothing it can be ordered to do exists.

**How it is picked.** `R2`'s picking functions, as pure functions over the replica and the camera matrices: the nearest object under a screen ray, and the objects inside a screen rectangle. A ray whose origin lands inside any panel rectangle of §2 is refused before it is cast.

**What it looks like.** A selected object carries a one-pixel `accent` outline in the world, drawn by the geometry pass from the render view's selection flag; there is no selection circle on the ground and no bracket. A rectangle drag draws a one-pixel `accent` rectangle over the world while the button is held.

**Groups.** Ten numbered groups, 0 to 9, held by the simulation through the `Group` order so that they survive a rejoin and appear in a replay. Assigning replaces the group. A group that has lost every member is empty and selecting it does nothing.

---

## 6. Orders on the world

**The default order** is what a right click gives, decided by what is under the cursor:

| Under the cursor | Selection | Order |
|---|---|---|
| Open ground | Devices | `Move` to that point |
| A visible enemy device or structure | Devices with a weapon | `Attack` that object |
| A visible enemy | Devices with no weapon | `Move` to the object's position |
| An own damaged structure | Devices with a builder | `Move` adjacent; repair is the builder's standing behaviour |
| An own structure plan | Devices with a builder | `Move` adjacent and begin it |
| Anything | A structure is selected | Nothing; a structure takes no primary order |
| The minimap | Devices | `Move` to the landscape point the minimap pixel names |

**An armed order** is one of Move, Patrol, Attack-move or Build, armed by its hotkey or by a button in the orders panel, which changes the cursor and makes the *next* left click on the world issue that order instead of selecting. Escape or a right click disarms it. Patrol takes two clicks, the second setting the far point.

**Shift queues.** An order given with Shift held is appended to the selection's order list rather than replacing it. The simulation's twenty kinds carry no queue (`GameShared/Order.h`), so the client holds the queue and issues the next order when the replica reports the current one finished. This is stated plainly as a client-side convenience, not a simulation feature: a rejoining client does not recover a queue, and `TechnicalDesign.md` §4.7 is not changed for it.

**Every order is acknowledged locally at once** — a one-frame `accent` mark at the target point and a sound — and the unit moves when the replica says it has. There is no client-side prediction (`TechnicalDesign.md` §3).

**A rejection is shown.** The simulation records a reject reason per seat (`S2`: `NotOwned`, `NotVisible`, `CannotAfford`, `AtCap`, `InvalidTarget`, `InvalidPlacement`, `NotResearched`, `NoCommandPost`, `Malformed`). It reaches the client in the frame, is drawn as one line of `warning` text centred at y 720 for two seconds, and replaces the line already there. `SeatState` carries it (`N4`, 2026-09-19) as three fixed-size fields — a wrapping `rejectSequence`, the `OrderKind` and the `RejectReason` — rather than the list the simulation keeps, because this section draws one line at a time. **The client redraws on the sequence and not on the value**: two identical refusals are equal field for field, so without it a commander who asks twice for what he cannot afford would watch the line sit there and read it as not having been heard.

---

## 7. The command panel

One panel, 768×288 at (800, 792), with five tabs along its title strip, selected by click or by the keys 1 to 5. The active tab's button is filled `accent` with its caption in `panelFill`.

### 7.1 Construct (tab 1)

A row of structure buttons, one per structure the seat has researched, each 128×64 holding a 32×32 icon, the name, and the cost in power. A button the seat cannot afford takes `buttonDisabled` and its cost takes `warning`. M1 has six structures: command post, extractor, generator, factory, research lab, tower.

Clicking one enters **placement**: the cursor becomes Build, and a footprint ghost follows the pointer on the terrain, a one-pixel outlined rectangle of the structure's footprint in cells, filled at a quarter alpha, `accent` where the placement is legal and `warning` where it is not. A left click places the plan and stays in placement so that a wall or a row of extractors is placed without returning to the panel; Escape or a right click leaves it.

**The ghost's legality is the client's guess and says so.** It is evaluated on the replica's copy of the landscape by the same rules as the simulation's placement — no structure, no feature, no water, slope under 25%, every cell explored, and a deposit under an extractor. The replica does not hold flatten deltas outside a structure's own record (`TechnicalDesign.md` §5.2), so ground flattened by a structure the commander cannot see can read as illegal when the host would allow it, or the reverse. The ghost is therefore advisory; the host decides, and an `InvalidPlacement` rejection is shown as §6 says. This is a known and accepted disagreement, not a defect to design around.

The panel also shows **the plan count**, *n* of 64, in `dimText`, and turns it `warning` at the cap.

### 7.2 Produce (tab 2)

Shown for a selected own factory; empty with a line of `dimText` otherwise.

- **The design list**, left half: every design the seat has saved, one row of 32 pixels each holding the name, the cost and the build time in seconds. Clicking one appends it to that factory's queue (`SetProduction`).
- **The queue**, right half: up to eight entries, the first with a `barBuild` progress bar and the seconds remaining, the rest as names. Clicking an entry removes it (`CancelProduction`).
- **The remaining time** is computed by the client as the ticks the replica reports remaining, divided by the tick rate. The host owns the arithmetic that turns builder rates into progress; the panel divides and prints.

A factory whose commander is at the device cap shows `AT THE DEVICE CAP` in `warning` where the progress bar would be, and the queue does not advance (`GameDesign.md` §4).

**There is no rally point in M1.** The twenty order kinds carry none (§11, gap for a later milestone), and a device appears beside its factory and holds.

### 7.3 Research (tab 3)

A scrolling list of the research items available to the seat, one row of 32 pixels each: the name, the cost, the time in seconds, and the effect in one line from the item's `description` field. A row whose prerequisites are unmet is not listed at all; a row the seat cannot afford takes `dimText` with its cost in `warning`.

Clicking a row starts it in the first idle lab (`SetResearch`). A lab that is researching shows above the list as a row with a `barBuild` bar and the seconds remaining; clicking that row cancels it (`CancelResearch`), which refunds nothing, and a confirm click is required.

**The auto-research toggle** sits in the panel's top right: a 24-pixel button that fills `accent` when on. It is a lobby setting per seat (`S6`), so toggling it mid-match is not in the twenty order kinds; in M1 the toggle is **read-only**, showing the lobby's value, and §11 hands the order kind to the milestone that adds a lobby.

### 7.4 Design (tab 4)

Requires a standing command post. Without one the tab shows `A COMMAND POST IS NEEDED` in `dimText` and nothing else.

Three columns of buttons — chassis, drive, modules — listing what the seat has researched, one selected in each of the first two and up to the chassis's mount count in the third. M1 offers three chassis, three drives and four modules, so the columns never scroll.

Under them, **the derived statistics**, from `GameShared/DesignStats`, recomputed on every change and shown before the commander commits:

```
SPEED        104 wu/s      HIT POINTS    100
ARMOUR      5 K / 5 T      SIGHT      20 cells
COST         130 power     BUILD TIME     13 s
```

A field that a research upgrade has raised is drawn in `accent` with the base value in `dimText` beside it. A design that cannot be built shows the fault from `DesignFault` as one line of `warning` — no modules, too many modules, or a module this chassis refuses — and the Save button is disabled.

A name field takes `WM_CHAR` characters, up to 24, and Save emits `SaveDesign`. Designs are per commander and saved between matches (`TechnicalDesign.md` §9). **There is no delete and no rename in M1**: the twenty kinds carry neither, and a seat holds at most sixteen designs, after which Save replaces the design of the same name or is refused.

### 7.5 Match (tab 5)

What the lobby fixed, so that a player can check it without leaving: the landscape's name and size class, the victory condition, the device cap, the starting power, the technology tiers, and each seat's kind and alliance with its commander colour. Read-only. It exists because M1 has no lobby and the defaults are otherwise invisible.

## 8. The selection panel

512×288 at (288, 792). What it shows depends on what is selected.

**One own device**: its design name, an icon, a `barHealth` bar with the hit points as `current / max`, the rank badge and rank name, the chassis, drive and modules as three lines, and the current order kind with its target. A device under half health draws its bar in `barHealth` until a quarter and `barHealthLow` under it.

**Several own devices**: a grid of up to 32 portraits, 48×48 each, each with a two-pixel health strip along its bottom edge and a one-pixel `accent` border on the one the panel's detail lines describe. Clicking a portrait narrows the selection to that device; Ctrl-clicking removes it from the selection. Over 32 selected, the grid shows the first 32 and a count.

**One own structure**: its name, an icon, a health bar, and its role's own line — a factory's current build, a lab's current item, a generator's served extractor count, an extractor's yield per second or `UNSERVED` in `warning`, a command post's trickle. A structure under construction shows a `barBuild` bar and the seconds remaining instead of health, because health follows progress (`GameDesign.md` §5).

**A structure plan** shows the structure's name, `PLAN`, its cost, and `NOT STARTED` until a builder begins it.

**A visible enemy device**: its chassis, drive and modules, its health bar, and its rank. Designs are not secrets (`GameDesign.md` §8). The parts arrive with the design record for the first device of that design a client sees; **until that record arrives the panel shows the health bar and `DESIGN UNKNOWN` in `dimText`**, and fills in when it arrives.

**A ghost structure** — one in an explored cell that the commander cannot currently see — shows its kind and the health it had when last seen, with the whole panel's body text in `dimText` and the word `REMEMBERED` in the title strip. It is never shown as live, because that is the one thing the fog exists to prevent.

**Nothing selected**: the panel body is empty but for a `dimText` line naming the two things a player who has just started needs, `LEFT CLICK TO SELECT` and `RIGHT CLICK TO ORDER`.

---

## 9. The orders panel, the minimap and the readouts

### 9.1 Orders (1568, 792, 352, 288)

Shown for a selection of own devices; empty for a structure or an enemy.

**Primary orders**, as a row of 48×48 icon buttons: Move, Attack-move, Patrol, Guard, Stop. An order that arms (§6) fills `accent` while armed. `ReturnToRepair` is listed and **disabled in M1**, because M1 has neither a repair bay nor a repair module (`S10`), with a tooltip saying so.

**Stances**, as four rows of small buttons, each row a mutually exclusive set, the active one filled `accent`:

| Row | Options | In M1 |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | At will / Return fire / Hold fire | All three |
| Range | Optimal / Long | Both |
| Retreat | 50% / 25% / Never | **Never only**; the other two are disabled with a tooltip, because nothing repairs |
| Movement | Pursue / Hold position | Both |

Each emits `SetStance`. A mixed selection shows no option filled in a row where its devices disagree, and clicking sets them all.

### 9.2 Minimap (0, 792, 288, 288)

The client area is exactly **256×256**, so a Small landscape of 128 cells is **two pixels a cell**, drawn without resampling — which is why the panel is this size and why M1 is a Small landscape. A Medium landscape would be one pixel a cell and a Large one pixel to four, and §11 hands the scale rule for those to the milestone that ships them.

Drawn back to front:

1. **The fog**, from the render view's fog grid: black where unexplored, the terrain colour at half brightness where explored, at full where visible. This is the same grid the fog pass reads (`K2`), so the minimap and the world can never disagree.
2. **Structures**, two pixels a cell of their footprint, in their commander's colour; a ghost structure at half brightness.
3. **Devices**, one pixel each, in their commander's colour. Only what the interest set holds, which is what the commander can see.
4. **The selection**, in `accent`, over whatever colour the object had.
5. **The camera frustum**, a one-pixel `panelBorder` quadrilateral where the frustum's four far corners meet the ground plane, clipped to the map.

A left click moves the camera to that point, keeping its height and orientation. A left drag scrubs the camera continuously. A right click issues the default order to that landscape point (§6). The wheel does nothing over the minimap, so that a player scrubbing does not fall out of the sky.

### 9.3 Power readout (0, 0, 400, 40)

One line, 16-pixel text, in `bodyText`:

```
POWER 1,240 / 2,000   +15/s
```

The stockpile and its cap, then income a second. **The stockpile and the cap are both `SeatState`'s** — this paragraph said the cap was not on the wire, and it was wrong: `stockpileCapHundredths` has been a field of the record since `N1`, written and read beside the stockpile, so the panel prints what the host says rather than recomputing 1,000 plus 500 a generator.

**The income is measured and not re-derived**, which is `K4`'s own finding (2026-09-20). It is "five a second for every served extractor plus the command post's trickle", and *served* is the host's word: `GameLogic/Economy.h` assigns each generator the four nearest unserved extractors in range and recomputes the assignment every tick, and nothing replicates the result. A client that re-derived it would be a second implementation of a simulation rule — the thing `TechnicalDesign.md` §5.3 keeps out of the replica — and it would also need the seat's research upgrades, which reach the client as a mask of completed rows and not as an extractor rate. So the panel reads the rate off `SeatState::extractedHundredths`, the running total of what this seat's served extractors have yielded: the rise over the ticks between two readings of it is the extraction rate exactly, upgrades and assignment included, with no rule copied anywhere. It is sampled over a second rather than over a frame, because a frame is two ticks and two ticks of extraction divided by two jumps whenever a generator picks up an extractor mid-interval. The command post's trickle is added to it from the replica's own standing command posts, which is a flat row value no assignment touches.

The stockpile turns `warning` at the cap, because income is being lost.

### 9.4 Match state (1520, 0, 400, 40)

The elapsed match time as `mm:ss` from the replica's tick, and, when the victory condition is Survival, the time remaining. Nothing else: a frame-rate counter and a network readout are a debug overlay, not this panel, and `G2` adds them behind F3 if it wants them.

---

## 10. Overlays

**The match-end overlay** (560, 380, 800, 320) appears when the seat's victory state leaves `Playing`. It fills the panel frame, shows `VICTORY` in `accent` or `DEFEAT` in `warning` at 32 pixels — the one place text is drawn at a size other than 16, as a doubled 16-pixel glyph, which is exactly 1:1 at twice the scale and stays crisp — the match duration, and a Quit button. The simulation stops advancing once decided (`S11`), so the world behind it is frozen and the camera still moves, which is deliberate: a player wants to look at the field.

**The quit menu** (760, 420, 400, 240) appears on **F10**, from either pointer mode: Leave match and Quit, stacked, with Back above them. It was a *pause* menu with Resume until 2026-09-20, when [`ADR-020`](ADR/ADR-020-central-server-no-lobby-no-pause.md) removed the pause — and it was on Escape until 2026-09-19, when Escape became the pointer's mode key (§4). Opening it puts the pointer in *point* mode and Back puts it back where it was; **the world goes on running behind it**, because the world is not in this process. It is the only way out of the game: a core window has no close box and Escape never exits (§7).

**The chat line** opens on Enter as a single-line field along the bottom of the world view, above the panels at y 760, taking `WM_CHAR` characters up to 128, and emits `Chat` on Enter. Messages appear as up to four lines of `bodyText` above it, each for eight seconds. M1 has one human, so this exists to prove the order kind travels rather than to be used.

## 11. What this document needs that does not exist yet

Each of these is a real gap found while writing this document, with the task that owns it. The ones marked **blocks K4** must land before the panels are finished.

**Rows 17 to 20 were added on 2026-09-20**, all four found while `K4` built the panels against this document line by line — a lobby nothing replicates, a click whose modifier no event carries, a design name nothing in the tree holds, and a tooltip with three constants and no text. None of them blocks `K4`: each is a line of a panel that says what it can rather than guessing, and each names the task that would close it. §9.3 was **corrected** at the same time: it claimed the stockpile cap was not on the wire and it has been since `N1`, and the income it asked the client to derive would have been a second copy of `GameLogic/Economy.h`'s service assignment, so the panel measures it instead.

**Row 7 closed on 2026-09-20.** With row 4 done by `C6`, nothing marked **blocks K4** is open.

**Rows 14 and 15 were added on 2026-09-19** with the owner's ruling on the pointer (§12, ruling 3). A cursor that lies on the ground needs the ground, and nothing in the tree can answer where a ray meets it or which way it faces there; that is row 14, and it is the one piece of §4's new cursor that is not drawing. Row 15 is the ring's texture, and it is owned by `K7` rather than by `C4` on purpose: `C4` is `done`, and the paragraph above this one is the record of what it cost the last time a live gap was hung off a finished task.

**Rows 12 and 13 were added on 2026-09-19**, found while writing `R2`'s `RenderViewBuilder`: its acceptance asked for features and projectiles before anybody checked whether the content behind them existed, and neither does. They are `C7` and `C8` in `tasks/m1-vertical-slice.yaml` as well as here, because this table is where a reader of the design finds a gap and the plan is where `Tools/CheckTaskDag.py` does — rows 3, 4 and 5 were lost for exactly the want of the second half.

**Rows 3, 4 and 5 changed owner on 2026-09-19.** They were given to `N1`, `C1` and `C2`, and those three tasks were marked `done` without them — the acceptance lines that would have caught it were never written, and `Tools/CheckTaskDag.py` reads the plan's YAML and not this table, so a row whose owner is `done` is invisible to the thing that schedules work. They are now `N4` and `C6` in `tasks/m1-vertical-slice.yaml`, where the checker can see them. Row 4 is also moved ahead of `K3`: this document previously said none of these blocks `K3`, which was true of the letter of `K3`'s acceptance and false of its intent, because a toolkit that hard-codes the palette leaves nobody owning the move to data that §3 promises.

| # | What is missing | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AuthoredFromClient`, the inverse of `FitAuthored`, with its round-trip test | `K3` |
| 2 | ~~`NeuronCore/RenderView.h` must carry a selection flag, construction progress, a commander colour index rather than a packed colour, the fog grid, and a wreck-or-projectile distinction~~ | **Done 2026-09-19 by `R2`**: `RenderInstance` carries all five, and `GeometryPass` takes `C6`'s eight commander colours once a match and resolves the index, so the palette is a table rather than a number copied into every instance of every frame |
| 3 | ~~A wire record carrying the per-seat order rejections `S2` already records, so §6 can show them~~ | **Done 2026-09-19 by `N4`**: `SeatState` carries the seat's last refusal as a sequence, a kind and a reason |
| 4 | `GameData\Interface.json`, the chrome palette of §3, and its loader row | `C6` — **blocks K4** |
| 5 | The eight commander colours, as a content table | Ruled in `GameDesign.md` §11 (owner, 2026-09-19); `C6` carries the table, and `R2` reads an index into it |
| 6 | The eight ranks' names, badges and percentages. `GameDesign.md` §6 says "a small percentage" and nothing more, and `S5` defers to a design that proposes none | `GameDesign.md` §6, then `C2` |
| 7 | ~~The icon list: six cursors and one icon per structure, module, order and stance, with `Icons.dds` laid out as a grid of 32×32 cells~~ | **Done 2026-09-20 by `K4`**, and owned by `K4` rather than by `C4` for the reason row 15 gives: `C4` is `done`, and this table's own heading records what a live gap hung off a finished task costs. `Tools/MakeIconAtlas.py` writes the sheet as eight columns of four 32×32 cells — thirty-two icons, one a cell, every cell named — and `GameData\Interface.json`'s `icons` table says which cell is which, a structure and a module by their own content ids. **The art is a placeholder and says so**, exactly as `Tools/MakePlaceholderModels.py`'s boxes are: each icon is a distinct simple shape drawn as a single-channel mask, which is what §3 asks an icon to be and what today's imported banners are not, so a panel of buttons reads as a panel of different buttons and the one wired wrong is visible at a glance. A few shapes repeat where the placeholder has nothing better to say — the chevron is Move, the order Move and the Pursue stance — and the names are distinct, so the owner's art replaces one cell at a time |
| 8 | Whether a structure's own "target priority" stance has options at all; `GameDesign.md` §8 names it and gives no set | `GameDesign.md` §8 |
| 9 | A rally-point order kind and a design-delete order kind. Both need a twenty-first order kind, which changes the wire. **A match pause was the third and is gone** ([`ADR-020`](ADR/ADR-020-central-server-no-lobby-no-pause.md), 2026-09-20): it is buildable — M1 built one — and a central server has no player entitled to stop the world for everyone | A later milestone; noted in `TechnicalDesign.md` §4.7 |
| 10 | The minimap's scale rule for Medium and Large landscapes | The milestone that ships them (M2, M3) |
| 11 | The survival clock's default duration | `GameDesign.md` §2 |
| 12 | A **feature table** in `Content`. `GameShared/Feature.h`'s `design` is documented "Row index in the feature table" and no such table exists — `ContentTree` has none and `GameData` ships no `Features.json` — so a feature reaches a client naming a row of nothing and `RenderViewBuilder` cannot draw one | `m2-skirmish/T13`. **Ruled 2026-09-19**: scenery is M2's, so M1 ships no feature table. The gap stays open rather than being papered over — `GameShared/Feature.h`'s `design` still names a table that does not exist and `RenderViewBuilder`'s feature branch cannot be exercised in M1 |
| 13 | ~~**What a shot looks like.** `TechnicalDesign.md` §5.3 sends projectiles as short-lived events rather than objects, and no row says what one looks like or for how long~~ | **Done 2026-09-19 by `C8`**: `ModuleDesc` carries `projectileModel` and `projectileLifetimeTicks`, validated like any other model reference and refused one without the other; `RenderViewBuilder` turns a `Shot` event into an instance of `RenderInstanceKind::Projectile` travelling from the firing module's `MarkerMuzzle` to the point it was aimed at, from the event's own tick, and drops it when its lifetime is over. The event that drives it is `C9`'s |
| 14 | **A ray against the landscape, and a normal at a world point.** §4's ground ring needs both: where the ray through the screen's centre meets the terrain, and the slope it lies against. `NeuronCore/HeightView.h` carries the samples and nothing else — no ray march, no normal — and the only ray-versus-world code in the tree is `GameClient/Picking.h`'s ray-versus-sphere, which never touches the ground. `GameClient/OrderInput.cpp`'s `GroundPoint` intersects a **flat plane at y = 0** and says why: a Move names x and z only, so the height is not worth a walk. That reasoning is sound for the order's payload and does not cover *which* x and z the commander pointed at — over ground at height h the plane's answer is off by about `h / tan(pitch)`, which at 200 units and a 26.6° pitch is 400 world units, six cells. One function serves the ring, the order and the footprint ghost | **Half done 2026-09-19 by `K7`**: `NeuronClient/GroundRay.h` answers both — a march of the sample grid against the terrain mesh's own diagonal, a bilinear normal from central differences that is exactly `(0, 1, 0)` on flat ground, a clean miss off the landscape, and the sea answered by its own plane rather than by the seabed under it. What is left is `CursorPass`, which needs a device, and `OrderInput` using this instead of the plane |
| 16 | **A factory's production queue on the wire.** §7.2 draws "the queue, right half: up to eight entries, the first with a `barBuild` progress bar and the seconds remaining", and nothing replicates it. `GameShared/Seat.h` keeps the queues — one list a seat rather than one a factory, up to `MAX_PRODUCTION_ENTRIES` of `{factory, design, remaining}` — and `SeatState` carries none of it; `StructureState`'s `buildPercent` is the structure's OWN construction and not what it is producing. So the Produce tab can offer the design list and emit `SetProduction`, which is the half that makes it useful, and can show nothing of what is queued. Found on 2026-09-20 while building the panels. **It is a wire change and therefore a task of its own**, not a line to bolt onto `K4`: a per-seat list of up to sixty-four entries is 768 bytes against `SeatState`'s 46, so it wants its own encoding — sent when it changes, as `designs` are — rather than a field on a record the encoder compares by value every publish | A later milestone; `m2-skirmish` |
| 15 | **The ground ring's texture and its blurred twin** (§4, added 2026-09-19). Not a cell of `Icons.dds`: the ring is a world-space quad that wants its own texture at 128×128 or better, and the dark pass wants a pre-blurred copy of it rather than a filter at run time (`SpeciesLook.md` §7.1). Owned by `K7` and not by `C4`, because `C4` is `done` and this table's own heading records what a gap owned by a finished task costs | `K7` |
| 17 | **The lobby's own settings on the wire.** §7.5 shows "what the lobby fixed, so that a player can check it without leaving" — the landscape's size class, the victory condition, the device cap, the starting power, the technology tiers, and each seat's kind and alliance — and a joining client is sent none of it: `JoinAccepted` carries the seat and the landscape's definition (`GameShared/Messages.h`) and no `MatchSettings` at all. M1's Match tab reads the lobby the SAME PROCESS chose (`Match::Settings`), which is honest for a host thread in this executable and is nothing at all over UDP. Found on 2026-09-20 while building the panels | A later milestone; `m3-multiplayer`, with the lobby that fills it |
| 18 | **A modifier on `NeuronClient/InputEvent.h`.** §8 says "Ctrl-clicking removes it from the selection", and an input event carries a key, a button, a position and a wheel delta and no modifier state at all — so the sink that consumed a click on a portrait cannot tell the panel which kind of click it was. The frame's polled view has `keysHeld`, but a panel is offered the EVENT and not the view, which is what makes a click land on the panel it was drawn over. One field on the event and one on `UiEventResult`. Until then a portrait click narrows the selection and nothing removes from it. Found on 2026-09-20 by `K4` | `K3`, in the milestone that needs it |
| 19 | **A design's name.** §7.2 lists "every design the seat has saved, one row of 32 pixels each holding the name", §7.4 gives the design screen "a name field that takes `WM_CHAR` characters, up to 24", and §8 shows a device's "design name" — and nothing in the tree carries one. A design is a chassis row, a drive row and a list of module rows in the simulation (`GameShared/Device.h`), on the wire (`GameShared/Records.h`'s `DesignState`) and in the order that saves it (`GameShared/Order.h`'s `SaveDesign`, whose four operands are all numbers). The name field therefore edits a string that reaches the simulation nowhere, and every panel that wants a design's name prints its index. It is a wire change and an order change together — `SaveDesign` has no operand left for a string, and `TechnicalDesign.md` §4.7's records carry no text by ADR-002, so the name is a per-seat table sent as `designs` are. Found on 2026-09-20 by `K4` | A later milestone; `m2-skirmish` |
| 20 | **A tooltip's text.** §4 gives the tooltip a dwell, an offset and a wrap rate, and `NeuronClient/UiLayout.h` carries all three as constants — but a `UiWidget` has no text for one, so nothing can be shown. §9.1 asks for one by name twice, on the disabled `ReturnToRepair` button and on the two disabled retreat stances, each "with a tooltip saying so"; in M1 the disabled fill is the whole of the explanation. Found on 2026-09-20 by `K4` | `K3`, in the milestone that needs it |

## 12. The rulings this document takes

Each is a decision this document made that a reader may reasonably want to overturn, and the owner's merge is the ruling. Overturning one is an edit here, not an ADR, because none of them is an engineering decision.

1. **Text is 16 pixels, monospaced, one face.** Against `SpeciesCanvas.md` §7, which asks for 12 and 13. The reason is in §3: at a fixed authored resolution, a size that is not the atlas's cell resamples every glyph, and pillar 3 is what the authored resolution exists to serve. Overturning this means accepting soft text or re-authoring the atlas at 12 and 13.
2. **One-pixel borders, no drop shadow on a panel.** Against `SpeciesCanvas.md` §3's 2-pixel border with a 1-pixel outer loop, and with `GameDesign.md` §11.4 and `K3`, which both say one pixel. The yellow-twice-with-shadow title treatment is dropped with it; the title's glow was Species's answer to text over a red gradient, and this document's panels are dark.
3. **The mouse aims the camera with no button at all, and Escape releases it** (owner, 2026-09-19; this replaces the ruling of the same number, which gave aiming to the middle button held). M0 bound aiming to the right button because no orders existed yet; D1 moved it to the middle button so the right button could give orders; the owner asks for Species's own arrangement, where the mouse is connected to the camera the whole time and a key releases it. What was weighed against it is that an aimed mouse has no pointer, and §5's drag rectangle, §7's panels and §9's minimap all need one — hence two modes rather than Species's single one, and hence the pause menu moving to F10 so that Escape means one thing.
   **The aim itself is taken from the raw relative counts and not from Species's cursor-warping.** Species's free-movement camera has no yaw and no pitch: it moves a virtual cursor, ray-casts it onto the terrain, rotates the camera's forward vector toward that world point by `sin(angle) × sqrt(dt)` a frame, and then warps the operating system's pointer back so it stays glued to it, the screen's edge clamp being what makes the turn continue (`SpeciesLook.md` §7.2). It is a fine scheme and it is the wrong one to port: `NeuronClient/Camera.h` stores yaw and pitch rather than a basis, `NeuronClient/RawMouse.h` already reads relative counts precisely because `TechnicalDesign.md` §6.5 wanted them "unclamped by the screen's edge and without the pointer acceleration Windows applies", and a per-frame `SetCursorPos` is the thing that behaves worst across two monitors and a high-DPI display. Species's own editor camera is the delta camera, at 0.005 radians a pixel, and that is what M1 takes.
4. **The world view is the whole frame and the panels sit over it.** The alternative, a world viewport above a HUD strip, wastes no pixels to occlusion but makes the scene 1920×792 and breaks the authored resolution ADR-004 fixed.
5. **Shift-queued orders are a client-side convenience.** The simulation has no queue and does not gain one for M1. A rejoining client loses its queue.
6. **The auto-research toggle is read-only in M1.** Changing it mid-match needs an order kind that does not exist.
7. **The footprint ghost is advisory.** The client can disagree with the host about legality over ground whose flatten deltas it has not been sent, and the rejection message is the correction.
8. **A ghost structure is visibly remembered**, in dim text under a `REMEMBERED` title, rather than drawn as live with a subtle difference.
9. **The minimap is 256×256 and M1's landscape is Small**, so the map is two pixels a cell with no resampling.
