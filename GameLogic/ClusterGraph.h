// The abstraction a hierarchical planner searches (TechnicalDesign.md §4.5). The landscape is cut
// into square clusters; inside a cluster, the cells a drive class can stand on fall into one or
// more CONNECTED COMPONENTS, and each component is a node. Two components of neighbouring clusters
// are joined where a cell of one is across a border from a cell of the other and both are
// passable. A search over a few thousand components then replaces a search over a million cells.
//
// WHY COMPONENTS RATHER THAN ENTRANCES. The usual hierarchical abstraction puts a node in the
// middle of each run of passable border cells. It is smaller, it gives better costs, and it is not
// exact: a run can span a wall inside its own cluster, and then one node stands for two places a
// drive cannot get between, so the graph reports a route that does not exist and a device walks
// into a wall. Both halves of that were built here first and both were caught by the flood-fill
// test - one node per run missed routes that existed, and treating a run as interchangeable found
// one that did not. A component cannot have either fault, because a component IS the set of cells
// that are mutually reachable. Reachability over this graph is the flood fill's answer exactly, by
// construction rather than by testing.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS. The abstract cost between two components is the octile distance between their
// representative cells, which is an estimate and not the true path length - a component is a
// region and has no single length. The refinement is exact, being a cell search inside each
// cluster, so a route is optimal in the small and approximate in the large. TechnicalDesign.md §12
// leaves hierarchical A* against flow fields to be settled by measurement; this is one of the
// numbers that measurement weighs.
//
// PER DRIVE CLASS, AND BUILT ON FIRST USE. Passability is the drive's. A class's whole graph is
// built the first time that class asks for anything, and dropped when the obstruction grid changes
// - on a Frontier landscape one flood fill of 256 cells per cluster, about a million cell visits,
// on an event that happens when a structure is placed rather than every tick.
