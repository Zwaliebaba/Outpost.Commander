// What a scripted commander knows (TechnicalDesign.md §7). An AI seat observes the simulation
// through the SAME visibility grid and ghost store as a human, into this small blackboard, and its
// behaviours read nothing else - which is what makes "the highest difficulty takes a power bonus
// and never vision" (owner, 2026-09-17) a property of the code rather than a promise.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS DERIVED, so none of it is state: it is rebuilt from the world and the seat
// every time the seat decides, and neither the hash nor the snapshot carries it. A blackboard that
// were state would be a second copy of the world that two hosts could disagree about.
