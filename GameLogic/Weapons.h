// What a weapon is and what it does in a tick (GameDesign.md §8; m1-vertical-slice/S10). The
// numbers are the module row's; what this adds is the rank and the research that modify them, so
// that stage 8 asks one question and gets the answer the design screen would show.
//
// A SHOOTER IS A DEVICE OR A STRUCTURE, and the difference is only where its weapons come from: a
// device's are the modules of its design, a structure's is the one module its row names (a Tower,
// a Bunker). Everything after that - range, reload, the roll, the damage - is the same, which is
// why it is written once here rather than twice in the two walks of stage 8.
//
// RELOAD IS ON THE RECORD AND THE RATE IS DERIVED. Device::reloadTicks counts down per mount and
// Structure::reloadTicks does the same for the one weapon a structure carries - a field of its own
// rather than a second use of workRemainingTicks, which is a factory's production countdown and a
// builder's, and which a mod that put a weapon on a factory would then have to share. What a
// research upgrade changes is how far the counter is set back, so an upgrade reaches a device
// already in the field on its next shot without anything walking the world (GameShared/Design.h's rule).

/// short-lived events rather than objects", so a client learns a shot happened from an Event and
/// from nothing else - and DIRECT fire leaves no other trace anywhere: GameLogic/Targeting.cpp decides
/// the hit at the trigger and keeps no Projectile, because "what flies is the client's business".
/// Without this list a direct shot is invisible to every commander including the one who fired it.
/// Indirect fire does create a Projectile, and is recorded here too, so that the client draws a
/// shell leaving the barrel at the moment it was fired rather than inferring one from a position
/// it never receives.
///
/// SCRATCH AND NOT STATE, exactly as GameLogic/Damage.h's DamageEvent is: filled and emptied inside one
/// Advance, so it is neither hashed nor carried by a snapshot. Two hosts that ran the same tick
/// produce the same list, which is what makes it safe to build a wire event from.
