// Stage 6 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): devices walk the routes the planner found, at the
// speed their parts derive, across the terrain their drive can take (GameDesign.md §6;
// m1-vertical-slice/S8). Integers throughout, and the tick is the clock.
//
// WHAT SLOPE COSTS, AND WHY IT IS SCALED TO THE DRIVE'S OWN LIMIT. GameDesign.md §2 says "slope
// costs movement" and §6 says a drive "sets speed as a function of terrain", and then the drive
// table gives a flat speed factor, a maximum slope, a water flag and a hit-point factor - and no
// terrain column at all. OpenQuestions.md Q23 put that gap to the owner, who answered on
// 2026-09-18: speed falls LINEARLY from full on flat ground to half at the drive's OWN maximum
// slope, and beyond that maximum the ground is impassable, which is the rule the cluster graph
// already cuts on. Scaling each curve to the drive's own limit is the whole of the answer: on a
// 20% slope tracks keep three quarters of their speed where wheels keep three fifths, so the max
// slope column buys handling on ground both can cross and not merely reach on ground one cannot.
//
// A DEVICE WALKS CELLS AND STEERS IN SUBUNITS. The route is a sequence of cells, because that is
// what the obstruction grid and the passability rules speak in (GameLogic/Path.h); the device walks at
// the middle of the next cell of it, and at the destination itself for the last. How far along the
// route it has walked is on the DEVICE and not in the route, because two devices can share a
// destination and therefore a route, and cannot share a position.
//
// A DESTROYED DEVICE MUST HAVE ITS REQUEST CANCELLED. The planner keys its jobs by device id and
// an id is never issued twice, so a job whose device has gone is never asked about again - but it
// stays in the queue and, if it was still being searched, goes on taking budget from the devices
// that are still alive. Nothing removes a device yet; S10 is the task that will, and
// PathPlanner::Cancel is what it calls when it does.
//
// NOTHING HERE READS A CLOCK OR A FLOAT. The turn rate is a binary angle a tick, the speed is
// subunits a tick, the stall is a count of ticks, and the height under a device is a bilinear blend
// of four int16 samples with one division at the end (AGENTS.md R16).
