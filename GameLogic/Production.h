// Stage 4 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): factories build devices from their commander's
// designs (GameDesign.md §6; m1-vertical-slice/S5). Free functions for the same reason
// GameLogic/Construction.h has them - this system holds no state of its own. The queues are on the seat,
// the factory's countdown is on the structure, and a tick moves one of the two.
//
// A DEVICE IS PRICED AND TIMED BY ITS OWN STATISTICS AND NOT BY A ROW. The design's cost is the sum
// of its parts (GameShared/DesignStats.cpp) and its build time is that cost divided by the ten power a
// second of GameDesign.md §6, less what the factory's modules take off. Structures are the other
// way round - their rows state a time and the builders' rates meet it (GameLogic/Construction.h) - and
// the two rules are the tables as the design authored them rather than an inconsistency invented
// here.
//
// THE COST IS DRAWN WHEN THE FACTORY STARTS ONE, not when the queue is set, which is the same rule
// construction follows: a queue costs nothing until it reaches the front. Cancelling gives back the
// share of the one in progress that is not yet built, by the same arithmetic a cancelled structure
// uses, so power cannot be parked in a production queue any more than in an unfinished building.
