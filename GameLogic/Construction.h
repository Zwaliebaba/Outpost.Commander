// Stage 5 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): builders begin plans, advance the sites they are
// attending, and put modules onto standing structures (GameDesign.md §5). Free functions rather
// than a class, because this system holds no state at all: the plans and the sites are structures
// in the world, the builders are devices in it, and the only thing a tick changes is a field on
// one of them.
//
// A BUILDER IS NOT ORDERED TO BUILD; IT ATTENDS WHAT IT IS NEAR. There is no build order in
// TechnicalDesign.md §4.7's table, and GameDesign.md §5 says a builder "drives there and
// constructs it over the build time". So a device carrying a builder module contributes to every
// plan and site of its own seat within that module's range, and construction begins the moment one
// is in reach. That is the whole rule, and it makes moving a builder the way a commander directs
// one - which is what the order table already gives them.
//
// THE TABLES STATE A TIME PER STRUCTURE AND A RATE PER BUILDER, AND THE TWO ONLY MEET THROUGH A
// REFERENCE. GameDesign.md §5 says a structure is built "over the build time" and several builders
// shorten it, so StructureDesc::buildTimeTicks is the time one builder takes. GameDesign.md §6
// gives the builder module a rate of ten power a second, which is Components.json's
// buildPowerHundredthsPerTick of 50. Neither says what a FASTER builder does to a stated build
// time, and the only answer that keeps both numbers meaningful is a ratio: a structure needs
// buildTimeTicks times the reference rate of effort, and each builder puts in its own rate a tick.
// Today's only builder module is the reference, so a structure takes exactly the time its row
// states, two builders take half of it, and a builder module twice as fast would halve it too.
//
// WHAT IS NOT RECONCILED, AND IS STATED RATHER THAN QUIETLY AVERAGED. The rows' build times are
// about 1.5 times what cost-divided-by-ten-power-a-second would give (a 400-power factory at 1,200
// ticks against the 800 that rate implies), and four of the six rows are at exactly 1.5. Devices
// are built by the other rule - m1-vertical-slice/S5's acceptance says "cost divided by 10 per
// second" - so structures and devices genuinely build at different paces. That is the tables as
// authored; nothing here corrects it.
