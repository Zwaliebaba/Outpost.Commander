// Hierarchical A* over the cluster graph, amortised (TechnicalDesign.md §4.5). This is the system
// that decides whether a large landscape works, so it is built in the shape the design gives and
// measured rather than assumed.
//
// THE BUDGET IS IN NODES EXPANDED, NOT IN TIME. A budget in milliseconds makes the result of a
// tick depend on how fast the machine is, which is a desynchronisation dressed up as an
// optimisation. A budget in nodes is a property of the state: two hosts expand the same nodes in
// the same order and reach the same answer on the same tick.
//
// A REQUEST IS SEARCHED ACROSS TICKS. Its open set, its costs and its came-from live in the
// request until it finishes, so a Frontier-sized route is spread over as many ticks as it needs
// instead of stalling one. The abstract search finishes first; the cells come after, and only for
// the clusters the device is about to walk (REFINE_CLUSTERS of them), the rest refined as it goes.
//
// THE ABSTRACT ROUTE IS A SEQUENCE OF COMPONENTS, not of cells. Reachability over that graph is
// exactly a flood fill's answer (Sim/ClusterGraph.h says why), so a route the search finds is a
// route that exists; what the abstraction gives up is the exact COST, since a component is a
// region and has no one length. The cells are exact, because refining a leg is a cell search.
//
// WHAT IS IN THE SNAPSHOT, AND WHY (m1-vertical-slice/S8's answer to the question this header used
// to leave open). A path is a pure function of the graph and the request, so a host that reloaded
// and re-requested would compute the same path; what it would NOT reproduce is the TICK the path
// arrives on, because the budget would start again, and a device that starts walking a tick late
// has diverged. So the queue joins the snapshot - but only the REQUEST and the route so far, never
// the search's working. A request still being searched is put back by running the same search over
// the same graph for the number of nodes it had already spent, which Path::nodesExpanded records:
// the open set, the costs and the came-from are reproduced rather than carried, and a Frontier-
// sized open set never goes on the wire. PathRequest is that record and Restore is that replay.
