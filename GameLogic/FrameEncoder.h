// Turning a simulation and an interest set into the frame one client gets (TechnicalDesign.md
// §5.3): what was created since the baseline whole, what changed as a mask and the changed fields,
// what left as a removal, the events of the interval, the runs of fog that changed, and the
// commander's own seat.
//
// THE ENCODER NEVER READS THE SIMULATION FOR AN OBJECT THE INTEREST SET DOES NOT NAME. That is not
// an optimisation: it is the shape that makes §5.2's guarantee testable, because the only way a
// record of an unseen object could reach a frame is through a set that named it.
