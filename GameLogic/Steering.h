// Separation steering (m1-vertical-slice/S8): the one flocking rule a commander's army needs, in
// integers. Devices that end a tick inside a radius of one another are nudged apart before the
// next, so that a column does not walk through itself and a group that is told to go to one place
// spreads over it instead of stacking on one point.
//
// THE PUSH IS NOT PURELY RADIAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE TRICK. Two devices meeting head-on are
// pushed apart along exactly the line they are travelling, so a radial push is a brake and they
// grind to a halt facing each other. Turning the push a quarter turn - always the same way round -
// makes it antisymmetric in a second sense: each takes the side the other does not, and they pass.
// Written as away-plus-a-quarter-turn rather than as a rule about which side is which, because the
// arithmetic is the rule and there is no case to get the wrong way round.
//
// A TIE-BREAK BY ID IS NEEDED FOR ONE CASE AND ONE ONLY: two devices at exactly the same point have
// no direction between them to push along. Then the higher id steps and the lower stands, in one of
// eight directions taken from the id, so that a pile spreads rather than sliding off along one
// line. Every other case has a direction and needs no tie-break at all.
