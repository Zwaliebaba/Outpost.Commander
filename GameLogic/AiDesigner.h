// What a scripted commander builds (TechnicalDesign.md §7, m1-vertical-slice/S12). A design is a
// chassis, a drive and modules, and the question is which combination to spend power on. The answer
// here is the one the acceptance asks for: **expected damage per power against the enemy
// composition this commander has actually seen**, through the same damage matrix the shooting uses.
//
// IT IS NOT A SEARCH. Every combination of the tables is a few hundred at M1's size and the
// evaluation is a handful of integer multiplies, so the designer walks all of them. When the tables
// grow past that, this is where a pruning step goes - not a cleverer scoring rule.
