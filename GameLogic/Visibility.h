// Stage 7 of the tick (TechnicalDesign.md §4.8): fog of war, computed on the host, which is also
// the replication filter (§4.6). It is the system whose cost the design names first, so it is
// budgeted and deterministic from the start rather than made so later.
//
// HOW A DISC IS COUNTED, AND WHY STAMPS EXIST. A cell is visible while its viewer count is
// positive. A viewer that moves must therefore un-count the disc it last counted BEFORE counting
// the new one, and the only way to un-count exactly what was counted is to remember it. That
// memory is the stamp: the cell a viewer's disc is currently counted at, and the radius it was
// counted with. It is simulation state - the fog counts depend on it and nothing else determines
// it - so it is in the hash and in the snapshot beside the grids.
//
// ALLIED SEATS SHARE VISION by a viewer stamping its disc into EVERY seat of its own alliance
// (GameDesign.md §2). The alternative, a union taken when the grid is read, was rejected: explored
// is history, so a union at read would leave a commander unable to see the ground their ally
// scouted an hour ago unless the history were unioned too, and unioning history every read costs
// more than writing it once. Seats of one alliance therefore hold identical grids, which is a
// little memory for a filter that is one subscript.
//
// THE BUDGET IS IN VIEWERS, NOT IN WORK. REFRESH_BUDGET_VIEWERS a tick, moved viewers first and
// then the least recently refreshed, so the result of a tick depends only on the state and never
// on how long the last tick took. Eight seats at the army caps of GameDesign.md §4 is 4,000
// viewers, and 200 a tick at 20 ticks is exactly 4,000 a second, so every viewer refreshes at
// least once a second at the worst case the caps allow.
