// The replica turned into a plain list of what to draw (TechnicalDesign.md §6.3;
// m1-vertical-slice/R2). This is the seam the whole layering rests on: Client draws a RenderView
// and never names a Device, so "the engine does not know the game" (AGENTS.md R9) is structural
// rather than a promise, and the executable holds no logic worth a test.
//
// WHAT IT FILLS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Devices, structures and wrecks as instances; the chunks this
// frame's structures flattened; the commander's fog. NOT features and NOT projectiles: a feature's
// `design` indexes a table Content does not have and nothing anywhere says what a shot looks like,
// so m1-vertical-slice/C7 and C8 own those and each carries its own change to this file
// (Design/Interface.md §11 rows 12 and 13). Leaving them out is the honest state; drawing a
// placeholder for them would be a decision about content taken in a renderer.
//
// THE CHANGED CHUNKS ARE COMPUTED HERE AND NOT RECEIVED, and that is a security boundary rather
// than a convenience. GameShared/Records.h says it plainly: "a snapshot carries the landscape's flatten
// deltas and the wire must not, because the terrain under an unscouted base is not public"
// (TechnicalDesign.md §5.2). A client generates the landscape from the definition it was given at
// the join and flattens it under the structures it can SEE - which is exactly why StructureState
// carries `y`, "the flattened height under the footprint". So a commander who has not scouted an
// enemy base has terrain that is still the landscape's own, on his own machine, and no amount of
// reading his memory says otherwise.
//
// IT REMEMBERS THE STRUCTURES IT HAS FLATTENED, which is the one piece of state here. The replica
// says what structures there ARE and not which arrived this frame, and re-flattening every
// structure every frame would rebuild every chunk of a base on every frame of the match. The
// builder keeps what it last flattened and reports the difference.

/// The wire carries no height deltas - they would hand a commander the shape of ground he has
/// never scouted (TechnicalDesign.md §5.2) - so the client levels its own landscape under the
/// structures it can SEE, and this is where that happens. It belongs beside the code that PRODUCED
/// the list rather than in the executable that calls it: OutpostCommander is an Application, so
/// nothing in it can be linked into a test DLL, and the property worth testing here is a full-stack
/// one - that the client's samples end up agreeing with the host's under a footprint he can see and
/// untouched under one he cannot.
///
/// IT USES GameShared/Placement.h's FlattenDelta FOR THE RECTANGLE AND THE WIRE'S HEIGHT FOR THE VALUE.
/// The rectangle is the samples a footprint owns - four a cell plus the boundary sample on the far
/// side - and taking it from the same function the host used is what makes the two agree sample for
/// sample. The HEIGHT is not recomputed: FlattenDelta fills its rectangle with the mean of the
/// landscape it was given, and a second structure whose window overlaps the first levels ground the
/// host had ALREADY flattened, so the two means are taken over different samples on the two
/// machines. The wire carried what the host levelled to, and that is what is written.
