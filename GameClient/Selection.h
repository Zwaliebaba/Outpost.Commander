// What the commander has selected, and the drag that is choosing it (Design/Interface.md §5;
// m1-vertical-slice/G1b).
//
// IN Replica AND NOT IN THE EXECUTABLE, which is where m1-vertical-slice/G1b's file list put it and
// where the repository's own rules will not have it: Build/CheckProjectFiles.py refuses a project
// that lists a source outside its own directory, and OutpostCommander is an Application, so an
// .exe exports nothing a test DLL could link. Logic that deserves tests therefore lives in a
// library. It belongs here on its own merits too - Design/Interface.md §5 calls this code "R2's
// picking functions, as pure functions over the replica and the camera matrices", and Picking.h is
// already next door. No layering edge is new: Replica is built on Core, Content, Sim and Net, and
// this needs only Picking and GameShared/Order.h.
//
// NO DEVICE AND NO WINDOW. Everything here is arithmetic over the frame's input, R2's picking and
// the replica's candidates, so it is a unit test rather than something only the capture can see.
// That is the same bargain GameClient/Picking.h struck and for the same reason: the rules here - which
// press is a click and which is a rectangle, what a rectangle may take, what an empty click does -
// are the ones that are wrong by a pixel or by one commander's units rather than wrong by a crash.
//
// WHAT MAY BE SELECTED IS §5's LIST AND NOT PICKING'S. NearestUnderRay answers with the nearest
// candidate of ANY seat, because inspection is a real thing a commander does: §5 says a click on a
// visible enemy "selects it as an inspection", with the selection panel showing it and the orders
// panel empty. A RECTANGLE is the opposite: it "never selects structures and never selects another
// commander's anything", which is InsideRectangle's own rule and why it takes a seat.
//
// A RAY THAT STARTS INSIDE A PANEL IS NEVER CAST (§5). M1's panels arrive with K4, so the list of
// blocked rectangles is empty here and the rule is honoured rather than remembered later: a click
// that the interface has already answered must not also reach through it into the world.
