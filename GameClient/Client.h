// The client end of the conversation (TechnicalDesign.md §5.5): it joins, receives frames and
// fragments, applies what is complete and in order, acknowledges what it applied in every datagram
// it sends, and carries its commander's orders reliably through loss. It holds no world - Replica
// does that - so what it does with a frame is hand it to a sink.
//
// IT IS PASSIVE ABOUT TIME. Advance() is called once a pass with the tick the caller counts, and
// everything the client does happens inside it: nothing here has a thread, a timer or a clock.
