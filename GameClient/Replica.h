// The client's world (TechnicalDesign.md §2, §5.3): what this commander can see, built by applying
// the frames Net's Client hands over, and nothing else. It is a FAITHFUL READING OF THE HOST'S
// INTEREST SET and not a second simulation - it holds no rules, advances no state between frames,
// and answers no question the host did not send it the answer to.
//
// That is what makes the convergence test of m1-vertical-slice/R1 possible at all: at every frame
// the client has acknowledged, this object equals what the host encoded for that seat, object for
// object. A replica that guessed anything - a device's next position, a structure's hit points
// while it is out of sight - would drift, and the test would have to say by how much rather than
// that it does not.
//
// IT IS A FrameSink. Net's Client owns the conversation and Replica owns the world, and the seam
// between them is one virtual call with a Frame in it.
