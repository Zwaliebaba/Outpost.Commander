// A device or a structure turned into the models that draw it (m1-vertical-slice/R2;
// NeuronCore/ModelDesc.h; TechnicalDesign.md §6.3).
//
// A DEVICE IS A TREE OF THREE MODEL KINDS AND THE COUNT IS A SUM. The chassis model carries a
// MarkerDrive for each place a drive goes and a MarkerMount for each module; a drive model is drawn
// at every MarkerDrive and a module model at every MarkerMount. So a design with two modules is
// three models drawn, and NOT a model authored for every combination of chassis, drive and modules
// - which for the catalogue GameDesign.md §8 describes would be a product nobody could author or
// ship. It is the reason the markers exist.
//
// THE ROW-TO-MODEL LOOKUP IS DONE ONCE, AT CONSTRUCTION. A component row names its model by string
// id and ContentTree::FindModel is a linear search over every model in the game, so resolving one
// per part per object per frame is a string search per handful of triangles. Every row is resolved
// here into an index into ContentTree::models - which is the id a RenderInstance carries, because
// NeuronClient/ModelBuffers.h is built from that same vector in that same order.
//
// IT COMPOSES AND DOES NOT DECIDE. Which objects are drawn at all is the interest set's, already
// settled by the host; where they are is Interpolation's; whether one is selected is picking's.
// What is here is the marker arithmetic and nothing else.
