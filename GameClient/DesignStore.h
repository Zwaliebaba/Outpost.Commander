// What a client knows about the devices on the field (TechnicalDesign.md §5.3). A DeviceState names
// its design by an index into its owner's list and nothing else, because a design is sent once -
// with the first device of it a commander sees - and every device of that design after it is four
// bytes lighter for it. This is where the one copy is kept.
//
// IT HOLDS EVERY SEAT'S DESIGNS AND NOT ONLY THE COMMANDER'S. A client is told the design of an
// enemy device it can see, which is what lets the selection panel say what it is fighting rather
// than name a box; the fog decides which enemy devices it sees at all, and that is the host's
// judgement, made before the record was sent (GameLogic/Interest.h).
