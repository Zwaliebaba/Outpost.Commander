// What the client holds about one object it can see (TechnicalDesign.md §2, §5.3): the wire record
// exactly as the host sent it, and whatever the client has to remember beside it.
//
// THE WIRE RECORD IS KEPT WHOLE AND UNCHANGED. It is not unpacked into a client-side struct, and
// nothing here is derived from it, because the convergence test of this task compares the replica
// with the host's own encoding field for field: a client type would put a translation between the
// two and the test would be proving that translation rather than the protocol. What the client adds
// - a motion, a ghost flag - sits beside the record and never inside it.

/// "A structure in `structures` is never here as well"), so the id never leaves the replica and

/// been removed the tick it reached zero - so this is a marker the wire can carry without a flag.
