// The datagrams host and client exchange (TechnicalDesign.md §5.3 and §5.4). Every datagram starts
// with a MessageKind, so the reader knows what follows before it reads anything; Core's Datagram
// owns the framing under this - the version, the length and the bounds - and this file owns what
// is inside one.
//
// A MESSAGE IS NOT A RECORD. The records of Records.h are fixed-layout aggregates and a message is
// a header plus lists of them, so a message carries vectors and is read with a bound the caller
// gives rather than one the stream chose. Every bound here is a MAX_ constant below, and a count
// over it is a refusal: a hostile datagram must not be able to make a host reserve memory.
