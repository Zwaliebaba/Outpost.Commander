// The host end of the conversation (TechnicalDesign.md §5.2 to §5.4): it answers joins, publishes
// each client exactly what its commander may know, takes the orders back and hands them to the
// simulation's queue. One simulation runs and the host is what tells everyone else about it.
//
// THE FOG IS ENFORCED HERE. GameDesign.md §10 is explicit that a modified client must see nothing
// an honest one does not, so the filter is the interest set of Net/Interest.h and the encoder never
// names an object it does not carry. That is the security property NetTests::InterestTests asserts
// over a whole scripted match rather than over one frame.
//
// IT HAS NO THREAD AND NO CLOCK. Advance() is called once a pass with the tick the host loop
// counts, which is the simulation's tick, and publishing happens on the ticks Sim::PublishDue says.
