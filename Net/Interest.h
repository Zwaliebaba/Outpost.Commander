// What a client is told (TechnicalDesign.md §5.2). This is a SECURITY boundary rather than a
// bandwidth one: the fog of war is enforced here, by the host, so that a modified client sees
// nothing an honest one does not (GameDesign.md §10). Everything the encoder may name comes out of
// this file, and the interest test asserts that nothing else ever reaches a frame.
//
// THE ONE LEAK THIS MODEL KEEPS, named in §5.2 rather than hidden: the landscape's DEFINITION is
// public. The seed, the size class, the tile list, the start positions and the deposits go to
// every client at the join, because they are known to every commander from the first tick in most
// strategy games. The flatten deltas are not: a structure's footprint reaches a client only inside
// that structure's own record or its ghost, so the ground under an unscouted base stays as the
// generator made it.
