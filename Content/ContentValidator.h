// prerequisite exists and the tree has no cycle, every unlock names a real component or
// structure, every model, texture and sound a row names is on disk, no id is duplicated, every
// number is inside the range its field declares, and every landscape's palette names a biome.
//
// The validator reports every fault it finds rather than the first, because a table edit usually
// breaks several rows and one pass should show them all. OutpostHost --validate prints them and
// exits non-zero; the game refuses to start.
